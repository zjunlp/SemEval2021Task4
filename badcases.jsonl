He carried his damaged bike a mile to the next transition in Yokohama to take part in the run and finished 42nd. Spain's Mario Mola won the event, with Bermuda's Flora Duffy earlier winning the women's event. \"My first reaction was to get back on the bike, get back riding,\" said Brownlee. \"But then I got to my bike and the handlebars were pointing in the wrong direction and I couldn't move it. \"I still wanted to run - I had not come all the way to Japan not to finish.\" Gordon Benson and Tom Bishop were the highest-placed British finishers in the men's race in 10th and 11th respectively. The 2017 series is led by defending champion Mola from fellow Spaniard Fernando Alarza, who was also second to Mola in Japan. Sophie Coldwell was the fastest Briton in the women's race as she came home fourth, one place ahead of compatriot Vicky Holland. Non Stanford, Jessica Learmonth and Lucy Hall were seventh, eighth and 11th respectively. Stanford and Learmonth also crashed in the wet conditions but, unlike Brownlee, were able to remount. In the Para-triathlon races, Britain won three gold medals, two silvers and two bronzes. Andy Lewis was first in the PTS2 category, and Dave Ellis and his guide Jack Peasgood won the men's visually impaired race, while Alison Patrick and her guide Nicole Walters finished top of the standings in the women's equivalent. Brownlee, an Olympic silver medallist at Rio 2016 and a bronze medallist at London 2012, had missed the first two races of this year's World Series - in Australia and the United Arab Emirates. In wet conditions in Yokohama he veered into the railings on his bike when trying to avoid a rider who had fallen in front of him. Rather than concede his race was over, Brownlee ran barefoot for the final half-lap of the cycling discipline - about a mile - carrying his bike. The 27-year-old eventually finished six minutes 56 seconds behind the winner. \"It was going quite well - the swim went really well,\" he said. \"On that course you want to stay high up in the field to avoid crashes. I was sitting in fourth to avoid crashes, but then an athlete just crashed in front of me. \"I was very, very lucky not to break anything in the crash.

{"article": "One man said a bag of flour in the city - which was taken over by so-called Islamic State (IS) militants in January 2014 - now costs $850. One family reportedly lived off grass during a four-day escape bid. As the Iraqi army and allied forces, backed by coalition air strikes, attempt to recapture the city, aid agencies say Falluja's residents - as many as 50,000 people - have no safe routes out and are likely to be caught in the crossfire. \"Food and medicines are in extremely short supply in the city. Some families have been going through garbage for food,\" the UN refugee agency's Caroline Gluck in Baghdad told the BBC. \"Some people were so desperate that they committed suicide. Children are showing signs of trauma, they're clearly terrified.\" Baahjet Ibrahim, an imam who has escaped and is in a refugee camp in Barzinjah, told the BBC: \"Those who are inside cannot leave and those who are outside cannot help them. \"There is no food at all. A sack of flour costs a million dinars ($850, \u00c2\u00a3580) and more. \"We demand that the security forces act with professionalism and dignity, like all the armies in the world, to let people escape, to receive and respect them, because there are children, elderly and sick people among them,\" Mr Ibrahim said. Escape from the city is fraught with dangers, those who have managed to flee say. \"[Civilians] have survived on dried dates and hot water from the river,\" says Becky Bakr Abdullah of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). \"They also tell me about an extremely dangerous escape where they have run in groups of 15 to 16 families, often barefoot, during the night carrying the elderly and sick with children. \"Along the way they have had to hide in big drainage pipes and raise white flags in order not to be shot at. Ms Gluck says the UNHCR was told of a family of six who \"spent four days hiding in a river, escaping from IS, waiting to be collected by the security forces, and they were forced to eat grass.\" \"It's very clear that people are taking extreme risks in order to leave Falluja but it underlines how desperate their situation has become,\" she added. A hotline has been set up for the civilians in Falluja who want army assistance to leave - but air strikes continue, fighting is expected to intensify, and IS threatens to kill those who try to escape. The NRC says it believes that just one family has escaped from the city in the past nine days. \"A human catastrophe is unfolding in Fallujah. Families are caught in the crossfire with no safe way out,\" says NRC Secretary General Jan Egeland. Foreign humanitarian organisations are unable to enter Falluja. They are providing help to people from villages nearby, who manage to exit and reach refugee camps. Ms Abdulla said the families she has met speak of \"an extremely dire situation\". \"There are mainly two reasons for why people don't escape,\" she told the BBC World Service. \"One is because they are obviously extremely afraid. There are bombs and rockets and shootings right outside their doorstep so people have stopped even moving outside their houses. \"The other reason is, and this was a mother of three who told me this, when rumours got out that their family wanted to escape, IS came to their door, started beating up their men and started threatening the family's lives.\" Faiq Ismali fled Falluja and is living in Barzinjah camp. He told the BBC that the people still there were \"being bombed randomly\". \"We are demanding that the government open a safe corridor for the families and protect them because they are between Daesh [IS] and the army,\" he said. Falluja has been under siege from Iraqi and pro-government forces for more than six months, and it has been under IS control for more than two years. The city is only partly-surrounded by Iraqi and allied forces. The BBC's Jim Muir, who is on the outskirts, says it seems the final all-out onslaught has yet to start, so fighting is expected to intensify. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is mobilising to distribute hygiene and shelter aid items to people who have fled the area recently. It warns that Falluja \"must not become another Ramadi\". Ramadi, 50km (20 miles) west of Falluja, was left in ruins after being occupied by IS fighters.

Ms Gillard said she did not have \"original memories\" of Wales but the fact her parents' \"formative experiences were there, that was the subject of our family discussions in the home, so the consciousness that I was born in Wales and that mattered, has been with me throughout my life\". Speaking to presenter Vaughan Roderick, BBC Wales' Welsh affairs editor, she explained how her father, who had lived in Cwmgwrach, was \"very interested in politics and he thought for both my sister and I that it was important we grew up with an understanding of government and policies and why they mattered and what fairness was\". She added: \"In giving us that world view, all of the examples were from south Wales; from him growing up in a coal mining village in Cwmgwrach, being one of seven children, not being able to complete his education simply because of the poverty of his family.\" She explained how he won a scholarship to finish secondary school education but ended up leaving school at 14. \"And so all of these things about fairness and equity, the importance of education, were burnt into my sister and I from very early on in our family life and they have been the values which have stayed with me,\" she said. She said she had been shocked to see the contrast between Cwmgwrach and her own childhood home in Australia when she visited. \"I remember, vaguely, my first memories of being in the migrant hostel when we arrived in Australia, but then all of my other childhood memories were of being in our home in Kingswood, a suburb of Adelaide, going to the local state school... we had a house with a big back yard. I mean, we weren't moneyed people but that was the Australian way of life. \"And then to go to Cwmgwrach to see the sort of housing people lived in... my grandmother, my father's mother, was still alive then and she lived in a house with an outside toilet and things like that. \"But also, to be surrounded by people you were related to, this was a completely different experience for me. \"For all of my life my family had been mum, dad and my sister, Alison, and we weren't related to anyone else in Australia and there you were suddenly in a village in south Wales where you are just related to so many people, so many cousins and aunts and uncles.\" Ms Gillard served as the 27th prime minister of Australia, and the Australian Labor Party leader for three years and three days from 2010 to 2013.

{"article": "With his dark sunglasses, his gun and his tattoos, he looks every inch the movie stereotype of the maverick American law enforcement officer, but until seven years ago Christian lived in Brechin. He swapped the east coast of Scotland for the eastern seaboard of the US when he was 21. He worked briefly as a bouncer in Washington DC before obtaining a licence as a bail enforcement agent, often referred to as bounty hunters. They are contracted by bondsmen, money lenders who offer to cover bail money for those who can't afford it in exchange for a 10% commission. If the accused fails to show in court the bondsman loses the entire sum unless a bounty hunter can track down the fugitive. In Virginia, like most US states, it is not only police who get to carry guns and chase criminals. Christian says: \"Every boy, every man wants to have the gun and go kicking in doors. \"It's exciting being like that but I prefer being the undercover detective kind of guy.\" He says he is not a typical bounty hunter and has a low opinion of some others who seem to delight in the macho violence of the job. Christian moved to the US seven years ago to track down his American father. He had been getting into a lot of trouble at home and could not get a job. \"Plus I thought Americans always looked a lot cooler in movies so I thought I'd give it a try,\" he says. In the BBC documentary - The Scottish Bounty Hunter - Christian tells how he felt the need to escape his home town because he was taking \"a lot of ecstasy\" during \"week-long parties\". \"There was bugger all else to do,\" he says. \"I feel like in Scotland I was supposed to die there.\" His mother tells the programme she is pleased he left. She says: \"They were getting into trouble with the police and drinking and hanging around with the wrong people. \"Brechin doesn't have anything going for it really. There's not a lot of work in the area. It's like some place to sleep now. \"There's no potential here for young people.\" Christian sees similar problems in Virginia. About 80% of the jobs he gets as a bounty hunter are drugs related. He says he wants to help offenders and their families get back to a normal life but he gets paid for finding and putting people back in jail. He says: \"I can't feel sorry for anyone or I'd just end up taking handcuffs off everybody. \"I've thought about taking them off many times and letting folk go but I can't do that. This is what I signed up for.\" Christian can use lots of different methods to track people down but his first port of call is Facebook, which can give him clues to where people like to go and who they might be with. He says he caught a woman in Maryland because she used Facebook \"check in\". Christian says he knew she was going to a beauty school but didn't know which one. \"She would 'check in' at this coffee shop every single morning,\" he says. \"Every morning she was there at the same time 'Getting coffee on my way to school' - on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. \"On the Thursday - no check in. Because I checked her into Winchester jail.\" As well as getting paid to put people in jail, Christian makes money getting people out. Four years ago he started lending bail money as a bondsman himself. In an average week he'll track down five or six people and bail even more out of jail. He says the job is stressful, dangerous and exhausting. \"Bounty hunters don't last very long,\" he says. \"I only know of three or four who have been in it as long as I have. \"They either can't handle the hours or can't handle the stress.\" But Christian says he keeps doing it because it is a chance to help people turn their life around. He says: \"I've got a lot of relationships with people who might end up going off the rails if I left. \"This is a job you can't do half-arsed. \"You are either going to be a bounty hunter full time or you are not going to be one at all. \"I've tried to get out of it two or three times but I just can't seem to stop doing it.\" The Scottish Bounty Hunter is on BBC One Scotland on Monday 13 February at 22:40.", "question": "Christian Matlock is a bounty hunter who spends his days and nights tracking down fugitives who have @placeholder bail in the US state of Virginia .", "option_0": "obtained", "option_1": "arrived", "option_2": "skipped", "option_3": "poured", "option_4": "joined", "label": 2}

They \"add to our understanding of the history of the camp\", said island historian Ian Ronayne. The site at Les Blanches Banques housed nearly 2,000 men from the German armed forces from 1915-1917. Dr Brian K Feltman, from Georgia Southern University in the United States, said the snowball fight showed prisoners \"breaking the monotony of camp life\". He said it could be an example of prisoners staving off \"barbed wire disease\", a form of depression associated with \"the boredom and regulations\" imposed on prisoners of war. Mr Ronayne, a WW1 blogger for Jersey Heritage, said some of the images showed tunnels which may have been used during one of the attempts to escape the camp. He said if the images related to one of these incidents it would be a \"fantastic find\". Another showed two sets of fencing at the camp - \"barbed wire on the inside... and then an electrified fence\" -  which was rare, according to Dr Heather Jones from the International History at the London School of Economics. \"I have not come across an electric fence being used for a UK home front prisoner of war camp before,\" she added. Capt Bowers served in the Royal Jersey Militia and took the six photos from late 1916 to early 1917. Helier Falle found the pictures in his mother's house. \"Rather than leave them sitting in a drawer for nobody to see, I thought they should be shared,\" he said.

{"article": "A teenage girl sits in a dimly-lit room wearing sunglasses playing the prelude to Bach's cello suite. A clip of this performance can be found on the internet. There is nothing remarkable about this until you learn that she is playing every crotchet and quaver using only the slightest movements of her head and thumbs. At the age of 11, Charlotte White suffered a blow to the head which caused her to lose all movement in her body. She spent five years in and out of hospital and eventually went into a period of rehabilitation, regaining movement in her head and then gradually her fingers. But she became very withdrawn: \"All I was expected to do was get physically stronger, which wasn't happening, so that was quite depressing. I only saw people who were meant to make my life better but it never seemed to happen.\" At 16, Charlotte began attending St Rose's School in Stroud and initially did not respond well to some of the activities on offer. She said: \"Music therapy is somebody sitting in front of you banging a drum or playing a guitar, and you're meant to tell them all your worries about life. It's incredibly patronising and very boring.\" Then she was introduced to the Bristol-based Drake Music project, an organisation that uses technology to help people with disabilities participate in music. There she starting working with Doug Bott and learned how to use very small head movements to break a magnetic beam, which triggers the notes. Using thumb switches, she learned to control the configuration of notes available, much like a guitarist changes chord shapes. Bott said Charlotte stood out from the beginning: \"She was someone who was interested in classical music, which not many of the young people I was working with at the time were, somebody who was interested in working on her own and in her own way.\" Eventually Charlotte took part in a concert at school. She practised extremely hard beforehand. \"I wanted to achieve at it because it made people see me as a person, rather than as a disabled person they made presumptions about.\" When Drake Music recorded her performing a Bach cello suite and posted it on the internet, it generated a lot of interest across the musical community, challenging the assumptions about what was possible using assistive technology. Watch Charlotte's performance But this raised questions about whether music made in this way should be entered for the same musical examinations as mainstream students using conventional instruments. \"I wanted to pursue music at college,\" said Charlotte, \"but establishments who grade musicians wouldn't recognise it and therefore I couldn't progress.\" The music examining boards do not accredit music performed electronically, but they are working with Drake Music to find ways of developing this area. For Doug Bott, it is early days. \"We're discussing ways of accrediting the quality of the music performance in a way that it's not linked to the particular instrument a person is playing,\" he said. And although Charlotte was not able to take the conventional instrumental exams, she did receive a Bronze Arts Award from Trinity College London. Her work has also received some international recognition. When news of her performing and composing achievements reached the organisers of a festival in Norway, they asked her to compose some music for the Northern Lights Music Festival in Tromso. Charlotte has chosen to pursue her academic studies and gained a place at university, studying social policy and criminology. This is an incredible feat of will and determination for someone who had been largely written off by mainstream society, and music was key to Charlotte's rehabilitation. She said: \"Music inspired me in the belief that I could achieve anything. \"I became more enthusiastic and had much more of a drive, and wanted to break the barriers and do the same things as everyone else, rather than just being bracketed as a disabled person. \"I started to enjoy life and experience things that the average teenager does.\" Charlotte White's Musical Fight will be broadcast on Sunday 27 March at 1330 BST on BBC Radio 4 and will also be available on the BBC iPlayer.", "question": "A devastating accident left Charlotte White struggling with severe disability and lack of @placeholder until she found the right type of music therapy .", "option_0": "events", "option_1": "knowledge", "option_2": "relationships", "option_3": "motivation", "option_4": "training", "label": 3}
{"article": "Brian Sherrard said there was a \"very significant risk to the administration of justice if anyone else observes this process\". The 15-year-old disappeared in 1994 after a school disco in County Donegal. She was last seen in a car driven by convicted killer Robert Howard. On Tuesday, Mr Sherrard said any redactions made by the PSNI legal team are likely to be modest. The coroner will make a general statement to the inquest on Wednesday about the nature of the material that has been held back. He said the risk of disclosure is an exceptionally serious one and relates to the right to the life and the right to privacy of the individuals involved. Lawyers for the Arkinson family raised a number of concerns with the coroner, before being asked to leave the court, along with members of the press and members of the public. Henry Toner QC said the documents he had seen, which were heavily redacted, seemed to imply that at one stage the police believed there was a link between the murderer of Sylvia Fleming in Omagh in 1998, and the Arkinson inquiry. He said this was the first time the Arkinson family had heard of any such connection, and that evidence as to why that line of enquiry was then considered not credible should be made public. Mr Toner added that the documents also say somebody was abducted by the INLA and interviewed at length as a suspect in the Arlene Arkinson disappearance. The name of that individual has been redacted at the request of the PSNI, along with the name of an individual who made an allegation to the police that Arlene was buried in her sister Kathleen's garden.

{"article": "Migrants are not only joining local congregations, but setting up their own churches too. The number of churches in Northern Ireland led by migrants has risen to more than 30 in recent years. These new churches are not only attracting people from ethnic minorities, but intriguing locals. The Redeemed Christian Church of God is a Nigerian-based church, but has become the fastest growing denomination in the UK and Ireland. They have set up three churches in Northern Ireland within the last eight years. The congregation includes people from a variety of African nations, the Caribbean, and both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Chris Ifonlaja, who runs one of their Belfast churches with his wife, says it appeals to people because it is a \"neutral place\". \"We did not experience the Troubles,\" he said. \"We see that as a blessing because we don't see all of the division, we just see people.\" The couple said they were conscious of the possibility that migrants joining their church may be slower to integrate into Northern Ireland. Angela Ifonlaja said \"we didn't come to run a church for migrants, it's just a church\". \"But I think what happens is when you go into a place where you are new in that place, it's natural that you gravitate towards those that you identify with, at least on a physical level,\" she added. Other churches have decided to make a permanent physical commitment to Northern Ireland. Iglesia Ni Cristo or Church of Christ, are headquartered in the Philippines. They began meeting in a house in Belfast 10 years ago with only a handful of people. In 2014, they purchased an old church on University Avenue and refurbished the whole building. The converted church has only been open a few months. Brother Philip Velasquez is the minister, and he said that his church is reversing the traditional flow of mission. \"It is very rare for a religious organisation which began in the far east - in an impoverished country - to actually spread its mission throughout the whole world to first world countries,\" he said. \"We're not only growing because of the immigration of Filipinos but also because of the conversion of many people who belong to those first world countries.\" These new churches may still be small in number, but they are seeing growth at a time when many traditional churches are losing members, and are challenging the old divisions in Northern Ireland.

{"article": "When it launched the first-generation Prius back in 1997, many scoffed. It was ugly, not terribly efficient and distinctly uncool. Eighteen years later, Toyota has sold nearly five million of the Prius, and it is now the best selling car in Japan. And so enter the Toyota Mirai, leading the charge for hydrogen vehicles, alongside Hyundai's ix35 model. The, now rather tired, joke about hydrogen is that it is \"the fuel of the future, and always will be\". Fuel cells were invented in the 1880s and work by taking hydrogen fuel and reacting it with oxygen to produce electricity. The only waste product is water. The problem with fuel cells has always been their cost, usually measured in millions of dollars. Somehow, with the Mirai, which is the Japanese word for future, Toyota has managed to bring the price down to around $60,000 (\u00c2\u00a338,884) and to squeeze it all into a family-sized car. The first thing you notice getting into the Mirai is its size. It is nearly 5m (16 ft) long. When trying to manoeuvre it out of the underground parking garage at Toyota's Tokyo headquarters I was convinced I would scrape the long nose against the concrete wall. It also feels heavy, because it is: nearly two tonnes. And then there is that price. It maybe cheap for the amazing technology packed in to it, but you can get a top of the range BMW 5 series or Mercedes E Class for less. It is big, heavy and expensive. So why is Toyota building this rather than, say, a conventional battery powered electric vehicle? The short answer is range. From Toyota's headquarters, I cruised silently down to Japan's first hydrogen filling station near to the Tokyo Tower. A full refill took just three minutes. Once back behind the wheel the Mirai's computer told me I could drive 350 km (220 miles) before needing to fill up again. That is more than twice the range of most battery electric vehicles currently on the market (although Tesla's Model S goes further). Bigger vehicles can have bigger hydrogen tanks and so longer range still. This is especially true for hydrogen fuelled trucks and long distance buses. Toyota clearly believes the age of zero emissions vehicles is here, and that hydrogen technology is going to be a big part of it. That is a big contrast to Toyota's old rival down the road in Yokohama - Nissan. The boss of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, has not been shy about expressing his disdain for hydrogen. Instead, Nissan is betting on lithium-ion batteries. Mr Ghosn also scoffs at the whole issue of \"range anxiety\" in battery electric vehicles. Speaking to him at the Tokyo motor show at the end of 2013 he gave me this response: \"Where is all the hydrogen infrastructure?\" he asked. \"It doesn't exist, it still has to be built. Where is the electricity infrastructure? Everywhere!\" This is a fair point. Right now, the infrastructure to support hydrogen vehicles is still patchy. To recharge your electric car, on the other hand, all you need is a power socket. The downside is that most battery electrical vehicles now on the market not only have limited range, they take a long time to recharge: up to eight hours. But that is changing. To find out how, I thought it only fair to take a look at Nissan's alternative to the Mirai - the Leaf. The Leaf is not new; it's already been on sale for four years. It has come in for its fair share of criticism; that its real world range is much shorter than Nissan's claims and that its battery life deteriorates faster. Once behind the wheel, the Leaf is immediately impressive. It feels and drives just like a normal family hatchback, except it is completely silent, and has rather astonishing acceleration. You very quickly learn that using that acceleration kills its range. Driving a battery car requires delicacy. You must stroke the accelerator rather than jamming it to the floor. But even with the gentlest of right feet, you will struggle to get more than 150km from one charge. This is where technology again steps in. Nissan's satellite navigation software tells you where all the charging stations are. Alternatively, you can press a button on the dash and the car will call a Nissan operator who can track your Leaf via GPS and tell you how to get to the nearest \"quick-charge\" station. \"Quick charge\" must be the future for battery-powered cars, and the key to ending range anxiety. Unlike your home electricity supply (which runs on 110 or 240 volts AC), quick charging stations supply 500 volts DC at a much higher current of 125 amps. Because of that, it can recharge your battery much faster. Using one just outside Yokohama we managed to refill the Leaf's battery to 80% in just 25 minutes. Right now, Toyota and Hyundai are both betting on hydrogen power. Honda says it will soon follow. But these new models are not about to change the world overnight. Just 700 of the Mirai will be made this year. If you order one now, the soonest it will arrive on your driveway is 2018. If you want a battery car, on the other hand, there is much more choice and it is cheaper. You can get the Leaf for around $26,000 (\u00c2\u00a317,000). Last year, BMW launched the impressive i3. Renault's Zoe model already offers a more affordable option. Ford, Volkswagen, Kia and Mercedes are all following with their own battery electric vehicles. And then there is the Tesla S, the most expensive and luxurious battery car yet. The Tesla also has a range of more than 400km (250 miles) on one charge. The really exciting thing about all of this, battery electric or hydrogen fuel cell, is that, after decades of false starts, the era of zero emissions vehicles has finally arrived - and, in the opinion of this test driver, they seem pretty good.", "question": "When Toyota puts its considerable bulk behind a new technology , everyone should @placeholder up and take notice .", "option_0": "listen", "option_1": "step", "option_2": "sit", "option_3": "sum", "option_4": "picking", "label": 2}

This is not acceptable, 40 years after the introduction of legislation in Northern Ireland to provide protection from sex discrimination in employment.\" In addition to the survey, the investigation also held focus groups with 57 women across Northern Ireland and spoke to 58 employers. The type of unfair treatment included being made redundant, overlooked for promotion, unwanted role change, loss of bonuses and negative attitudes. Issues during pregnancy included problems getting off for doctors' appointments and no health and safety risk assessment. The women involved in the investigation had a good level of awareness of employment rights but there was a reluctance to take formal action either within the organisation or to an employment tribunal. The reasons given included too stressful, too costly and possibly career damaging. However, Dr Collins said it was encouraging that almost half of respondents thought they were treated fairly during their pregnancy and on their return to work. The majority of firms had policies in place, such as flexible working arrangements, childcare vouchers and return to work incentives, such as phased return and bonus payments. But some, particularly smaller firms, highlighted the challenges including accommodating flexible working requests and covering absences.

{"article": "Malaysian PM Najib Razak said experts in France had \"conclusively confirmed\" the wing part found on an island in the Indian Ocean was from the aircraft. But French investigators stopped short of confirming the link, only saying it was highly likely. Chinese relatives staged a protest outside the airline's Beijing offices. The Boeing 777 was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014 when it vanished from radar. It had 239 people on board, most of them Chinese. Debris found on the remote French island of Reunion a week ago - a wing part known as a flaperon - was the first possible physical trace of the aircraft. Experts in the French city of Toulouse are carrying out tests on the aircraft piece. Mr Najib, in an announcement that came after the first day of tests, said investigators had \"conclusively confirmed that the aircraft debris found on Reunion Island is indeed from MH370\". Malaysian transport minister Liow Tiong Lai said elements of the flaperon, including the paint colour, matched with maintenance records for the missing flight. He also said, in another development, that more suspected plane debris had been found on Reunion, including window panes and seat cushions. Those items had been sent to French authorities to be verified, he said, although French investigators have denied this. Mr Liow said he understood why the French team had been less categorical in their conclusions over the flaperon, saying: \"We respect their decision to continue with their verification.\" French prosecutor Serge Mackowiak has said only that there are \"very strong indications\" that the flaperon does belong to MH370, adding that confirmation would only come after further tests. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says Mr Mackowiak's wording does not suggest he has doubts, but that he is exercising legal caution. Will the debris lead us to MH370? But the lack of a consistent message from the various authorities has angered many of the families of those missing. A number of relatives gathered outside Malaysia Airlines' offices in Beijing to demand answers. \"France is being cautious about it, but Malaysia is desperate to put an end to this case and run away from all responsibilities,\" said Dai Shuqin, sister of one of the passengers. \"We suspect that the plane wreckage could be faked,\" said Liu Kun, whose younger brother was on the plane.

{"article": "Theresa May, who must be relishing a break from trying to keep order in her cabinet, is spending a few days at Lake Garda in northern Italy with husband Philip. She'll then return for an engagement before heading to Switzerland for a two-week walking break. It will probably look a bit like this: Switzerland - it's in Europe, but is pretty neutral in Brexit terms - was also a destination of choice for ex-PM Margaret Thatcher. When she went walking in Snowdonia in April, Mrs May decided to call the snap general election that ended up losing the Conservatives their majority. What effect will the mountain air have this time? Cornwall is a firm favourite of prime ministers - particularly David Cameron, who frequently holidayed there: In August 2003 Tony Blair stayed in Sir Cliff Richard's Barbados holiday home. The singer later revealed he had offered the Caribbean villa, where Mr Blair and his family stayed for three weeks, because the prime minister looked so \"gaunt and tired\" as debate raged about the Iraq war. The following year Mr Blair stayed at the Sardinian villa of Italian counterpart Silvio Berlusconi, reportedly leaving him hobbling after a challenge in a \"friendly\" football match. Another Italian villa he stayed at was in Tuscany, and owned by Labour MP and former paymaster general Geoffrey Robinson. Mr Cameron's much-documented habit of posing for photographs pointing at fish is an easy one to replicate. This one was in Portugal in 2013. Fairly standard behaviour for most of us -  and two years ago, on an Easyjet flight to Portugal, David Cameron might have thought he was away from prying eyes as he tucked into a tube of Pringles. Twitter, and in particular a teenager called Ashleigh who posted footage of the apparently oblivious PM, thought otherwise. \"Guys I'm crying he was eating Pringles,\" she informed her followers. This one's a bit harder to achieve - but former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major managed it in 2013 in the Spanish town of Candeleda. Local politicians voted to name the Avenida de John Major in honour of his annual holiday visits during his time in Downing Street. Sir John was invited to the naming ceremony in the town, 100 miles from Madrid, which he described as one of the \"jewels\" of Spain. In 2008 Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was under pressure after his party's shock defeat in the Glasgow East by-election, and his summer holiday didn't get off to a very relaxing start at a Norfolk country park as he fielded reporters' questions about his future. \"I think everybody's ready for a holiday at this time of year,\" he told them. The PM's formal choice of attire - beige jacket and dark trousers - was markedly different to the then Tory leader David Cameron's barefoot appearance on a Cornish beach. \"It might not quite have been a scene from Baywatch but the contrast with Mr Brown could scarcely have been greater,\" the Daily Telegraph noted. But once he became prime minister, Mr Cameron's holiday fashion often came under fire. In 2013 his outfit, including loafers without socks, was branded a \"sartorial shocker\" by the Daily Mail's Quentin Letts. Tipping etiquette can be confusing in foreign countries - and when David Cameron and wife Samantha didn't leave one after paying for their cappuccinos in an Italian cafe in 2011, it did not go unnoticed. The PM returned to the Dolcenero cafe in Montevarchi, Tuscany, leaving a healthy tip to make amends. The waitress told reporters Mr Cameron had apologised for any fuss the incident had caused. The news doesn't stop coming during the summer holidays, and prime ministers have frequently had to cut short their trips as events intervened. David Cameron returned home from Italy in 2011 as riots broke out in London, and Gordon Brown abandoned his 2007 trip to Dorset after just a few hours to chair crisis talks over foot-and-mouth disease. Even without returning home, prime ministers have to be ready to act from their holiday homes. With stories of plotting ministers in the newspapers, Mr Cameron's former head of political press, Giles Kenningham, says Mrs May needs to find a way to \"assert herself\" and avoid a \"vacuum\" while she's away. \"She needs to be visible when she's abroad,\" he says.

Activity is also up. The number of daily trades in Bitcoin, which is more established, has rocketed from around 40,000 at the start of 2013 to more than 330,000 today. About 2,700 participants attended an industry conference in New York this week, according to Michael Crosby, head of strategy for CoinDesk, which hosted the event. Mr Rosenblatt, one of the people in attendance, works with smaller investment firms and start-ups, navigating issues relating to coin offerings and \"smart contracts\", which use similar technology to enforce and verify business transactions. In the last year, the number of clients looking for that work has increased from one to about two dozen, he says. \"Our firm is kind of a middle America firm, so the fact that we're seeing that sort of interest speaks to how much the industry has grown,\" he says. Grayscale launched its first digital currency investment trust in 2013. The New York firm now manages about $400m of investments in digital currencies, up from $60m at the end of 2015, as its client base of wealthy investors, hedge funds and other small firms has grown, and prices for Ethereum and Bitcoin have climbed. \"We've seen just an absolute explosion,\" says Matthew Beck, an associate at the firm. Bitcoin: Is the crypto-currency doomed? 'I bought Bitcoins in 2011 - now they're worth \u00c2\u00a319,000' Bitcoin value tops gold for first time Mr Beck says the firm expects to continue to attract interest, as investors use digital assets to diversify. \"We're seeing investors start to diversify... and carve out an allocation for digital assets,\" he says. At the moment Bitcoin is used for cross-border transfers, payments for online activities such as gaming and gambling - and as an investment, says Peter Smith, chief executive of Blockchain, one of the major trading platforms. The currency also made headlines as the preferred currency of the hackers behind the recent attack that crippled the National Health Service in the UK and other organisations around the world. Industry members say some companies may be buying up Bitcoin to deploy in the event of a future attack, but they maintained that broader demand is driving price gains. \"There's a number of people from family offices [and] private equity firms - they're making small bets and when you add that type of liquidity to the market, that's going to drive the price up,\" says Mr Crosby. This year's Consensus conference drew some big corporate names, such as insurer State Farm, carmaker Toyota, and consulting firm Deloitte. Fidelity Investments, a staid, Boston-based money manager known for handling retirement accounts, was one of the presenters. It now accepts Bitcoin in its cafeteria and will soon launch a feature to allow clients to check on their digital currency holdings alongside other investments. In the scheme of global finance, a $30bn market remains \"trivial\", says Blockchain's Peter Smith. But interest from those players is a sign the industry is becoming more accepted. \"It has truthfully gotten a lot more mainstream and that's a beautiful thing to see in many ways,\" he says. For 49-year-old Stuart Fraser, the climbing price has meant a tidy return on the roughly \u00c2\u00a315,000 worth of Bitcoin he bought in early 2014. He estimates his holdings have more than doubled, even after subtracting the Bitcoin he used to buy a virtual reality headset and make investments in the newer Ethereum. Investors say they are prepared for a boom-bust cycle as the market continues to evolve, technology changes, and regulations come into play. But Mr Fraser, the managing director of Scotland-based financial technology start-up Wallet.Services, who previously worked in cyber-security, says unless he sees a promising new competitor, he doesn't plan to cash in now. \"I think [in the] long term, it's going to go up.\"", "question": "The price of Bitcoin , a digital currency once located at the @placeholder of finance , has been rising to new records in recent months as digital assets move into the mainstream .", "option_0": "fringe", "option_1": "centre", "option_2": "top", "option_3": "university", "option_4": "hands", "label": 0}
{"article": "The delivery man arrives with a large cardboard box. Following him through Dark Side Comics in Chelmsford is the fluorescent-haired Miss Ringsell. She beckons him towards the rear of the store, where there's enough space to put the box down on the floor. The delivery man has to steal Miss Ringsell's attention away from the package to get a signature. Moments later, he's off. And she's in, slicing through tape and tearing open the box flaps. Today is Wednesday. Miss Ringsell likes weekends, but she loves Wednesdays. \"Wednesdays are awesome,\" she says. \"It's when all the new comics and merchandise come out.\" The scent of fresh ink, paper and cellophane wrap draws in comic lovers from across the city and beyond, eager to get their hands on the very latest output from the comic world. \"There's a strong community feel on Wednesdays,\" says Miss Ringsell. \"People will talk about what they're reading and strike up conversations.\" What is now Miss Ringsell's career began as a youthful pastime. \"My love of comics started when I was pretty young,\" she says. \"My dad was the one who got me into animated movies and comics. \"I used to do a lot of drawing as a kid, and comics seemed a natural thing to draw from. \"He would bring me home comics and I would read them and then draw from them.\" Her first comics were from the X-Men series before she moved on to Batman - \"the coolest\", says Miss Ringsell. Her first Batman comic was the 1988 graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke by comic book legend Alan Moore, whose other works include Watchmen and V for Vendetta. By the age of 14, she was hooked. But her passion for comics isn't something that others always readily accept. \"I have had the odd comment here and there and people usually assume I either just work here or that I am someone's wife or daughter,\" she says. \"I have even had telesales people phone up and say: 'gosh, a woman with a comic shop', and I am like, 'yes, a woman with a comic shop'. \"It can be a male-dominated industry, but we are fighting through.\" And the battle hasn't simply been one of challenging the occasionally sexist attitudes of customers and callers, as Miss Ringsell explains. \"The 1990s was a terrible time for female characters in comics - a lot of them ended up chopped up into bits or put in fridges,\" she says. \"Female characters were being murdered as plot devices for male protagonists, or they were there just to be looked at. \"There are some really great female characters now. Personally, my favourites are Batgirl, Squirrel Girl and Jem and the Holograms. \"There are now female characters for all ages.\" Olivia Hicks, a doctoral research student of British and American comics at the University of Dundee, points out there is a rich history of strong female characters. As far back as the 1930s, there was Lois Lane who, when Superman failed to save the day, would set about sorting out whatever crisis needing dealing with. And in the 1940s, as well as Wonder Woman, there was Miss Fury, who would don a catsuit that gave her increased speed as she fought against Nazi agents. \"She was such a fantastic character,\" says Ms Hicks, whose own current favourites include Mark Waid's Archie, Hawkeye and Jem and the Holograms. \"There have been strong female characters in British comics too, stretching back to the first girls' comic, School Friend, and its cover stars The Silent Three - which were drawn by a woman, Evelyn Flinders - who donned robes to solve mysteries and foil bullies at their school. \"Popular characters like Bella at the Bar (Tammy) and Valda (Mandy) exhibited immense courage and strength and, in the case of Valda, often refused to listen to authority figures. It was her way or the highway.\" Miss Ringsell believes one of the biggest shifts in contemporary comic depictions relates to body diversity. \"All the women used to have the same body. It was the hourglass body only. \"There are now more body types for both men and women. \"I never understood why they made She-Hulk skinny because, surely, she should be enormous. \"And I think it is really important that women have strong role models whether on television, in films or in comics. \"If you start with someone like Batgirl or a Spider-Gwen, you have a strong female character from the off rather than women being there to be either saved or stared at.\" But what of diversity of tone and plot dynamics? Oxford-based comic creator Kate Brown thinks the larger publishers could be more open-minded. \"I've had scenarios where I've presented ideas that have had to be drastically changed as they were considered too gentle,\" she says. \"That is, I've focused on emotions or concepts of interpersonal drama. \"I was often told to ramp up the excitement by adding action, or high-concept ideas, that kind of thing. \"It's frustrating... and then it's like, do I refuse to do this? Or do I change this to something I enjoy far less so I can get a chance to work in this industry? \"While action-focused or high-concept ideas certainly don't automatically equal 'brainless', it worries me that this kind of reaction from some publishers or editors means we're losing out on work from some wonderful creators, and also losing out on potential readers, too. \"I love comics very much and I think comics can be, and should be, for everyone.\" It's a sentiment shared by Miss Ringsell, who says she has begun to notice a changing demographic in the comic book world. \"I am seeing a lot of younger girls getting into comics, largely from secondary schools,\" she says. \"A lot of women in comics are making contact with each other and creating our own communities. \"We now feel we are part of a collective.\"", "question": "If you believe superheroes are just for men and boys , Holly Ringsell would urge you to think again .

{"article": "On 28 November, 22-year-old Aarti and 19-year-old Pooja boarded a state-run bus on their way home from college. In the 40-second video of that bus ride, Pooja can be seen hitting a man with a belt while he holds Aarti down by her collar. The second man is partially hidden behind his friend. The third man is not seen and at what point he joins the duo is still unclear. The three men were arrested on charges of sexual harassment but later released on bail. They have denied the allegations against them. Local police chief Shashank Anand said it took a long time to trace witnesses as the road transport department does not keep a list of passengers. \"Identifying passengers was a painstaking process, even after we traced them, only a few agreed to testify and they too requested that their identities be kept secret,\" he said. Pradeep Malik, the lawyer representing the accused men, showed us many signed statements saying they were from the passengers on the bus. \"All these witnesses tell us the truth behind the video,\" he says. \"They said there was no sexual harassment, and that the sisters started the fight for a seat on the bus.\" The statements, copies of which are with the BBC, narrate the same sequence of events. In fact, two statements are identical except for the names and signatures of the witnesses. The sisters' lawyer, Attar Singh Pawar, alleges that the statements are fabricated and the investigators are not making enough effort to verify them. \"Three women who are being presented as witnesses were in their village at the time of the incident, but when other villagers came to the police to testify, their statements were not taken.\" At first glance, their life looks unchanged, except for the constant presence of policewomen who have been assigned to protect the sisters. Aarti and Pooja appear calm, but beneath their calm exterior, something seems different. Pooja says if faced with sexual harassment again, they won't fight back. \"We will always be haunted by the crying faces of our parents. They have heard nasty remarks about us from the police and faced pressure to withdraw the case,\" she says. The sisters were hailed as heroines, but things changed a few days later when a second video emerged showing them attacking another man. \"The Haryana state government which had announced an award to honour our bravery cancelled it later, and that has lowered our credibility,\" says Aarti. \"Now everyone questions our character, they say we go looking for trouble and assault people for money. Their real problem is with women raising their voice.\" The sisters allege that during a lie-detector test that they agreed to take as part of the investigation, they were subjected to humiliating questions about their sexual history - a charge police refused to comment on. The main accused Kuldeep, 20, is soft spoken and appears too shy to meet my eyes while answering my questions. On being asked if his friends tease him for getting beaten up by women, he shakes his head to say \"no\". Deepak, another accused, is more forthcoming: \"There is no sexual harassment in our area or on that bus route. Nothing happened that afternoon, the women just stood up and started beating Kuldeep with a belt. \"The police should have done something by now, our mind is not at peace and there is constant stress, especially about our careers,\" he says. Kuldeep and Deepak had cleared an initial test to join the army, but after they were charged with sexual harassment, they were barred from appearing in the final exam. In two years, they will be past the maximum age limit for the exam. \"Our entire village is supporting us and that's a big relief. Otherwise, these days only women's voice is being heard everywhere,\" says Kuldeep. A mere mention of Aarti and Pooja in the village has many men sniggering and there is consensus on who is at fault in that incident. \"If girls kept beating up boys like this, all boys would be dead, then what would the girls do?\" an old man asks. The women celebrate the fightback. Haryana is infamous for having the lowest sex ratio in India, and such incidents are rare. A group of middle-aged women giggle as one of them says, \"I haven't seen the video, but have heard that the sisters used their leather belt like a whip. That is fantastic.\" It is not unfettered support though. Sexual harassment or eveteasing - as it is locally known - is considered \"normal\" with a certain level of \"accepted\" tolerance. \"Why did they react? So many girls travel on buses, they don't go around beating boys,\" says one woman. Female students in Aarti and Pooja's college too see them as \"heroines\". \"Who doesn't want to react? We face harassment every day, but we have to be patient. If only we knew that our parents would support us the way these sisters' parents did, we wouldn't be scared to fight back either,\" says a student.", "question": "Six months after two Indian sisters made headlines when a video showing them fight three alleged molesters on a bus went viral , there is still no @placeholder on what happened that afternoon and there remain many unanswered questions .

Water quality in parts of the river had been classified as \"poor\" and \"bad\" by Natural Resources Wales. The Ely flows for about 24 miles (39km) from south of Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taff, and then through the city suburbs of Pentrebane and Caerau into Cardiff Bay, passing landmarks like the Museum of Welsh Life at St Fagans and Cardiff City Stadium. An inquiry into pollution on the river was initially carried out by Cardiff council's environmental scrutiny committee after complaints from anglers that the upper reaches of the Ely were devoid of fish and wildlife. Several organisations including Natural Resources Wales, Dwr Cymru, Keep Wales Tidy, South East Wales Rivers Trust, Cardiff Rivers Group, Glamorgan Anglers and Groundwork Wales came on board. The intensive survey carried out along the Ely and its tributaries was the first of its kind on a Welsh river. Councillor Paul Mitchell, chairman of the environmental scrutiny committee, said it had highlighted the \"devastating impact\" litter and other forms of pollution was having. \"We found hundreds of major tipping incidents and very large objects in the river, people travelling across three or four fields just to throw a trolley in the river,\" he explained. \"We also found sewage outfalls that Dwr Cymru Welsh Water were not aware of because they inherited an antiquated Victorian system. \"And further up in the catchment we saw the effects of unscrupulous builders who deliberately misconnect showers and granny flats directly into the storm drains so they don't have to pay connection fees to Dwr Cymru. \"It all adds up to kill a river off and it's about time we did something to sort it out.\" A number of projects, involving school and the community, will now be carried out to target the issues raised in the survey. Keep Wales Tidy, which lead the work of compiling the survey, is now preparing an online resource, mapping pollution points along the river. Pam Bacon, from the charity, said the partnership approach between different organisations, the council and community \"had to be the way forward\". \"It's a way of getting that pride and awareness back about the value of our rivers but also show what the different organisations are doing to tackle their own issues,\" she said. Imogen Brown, head of Dwr Cymru Welsh Water waste water networks, said the survey had provided \"fantastic information\". \"We have 7,000km of rivers in Wales and we can't understand everything that's going on in all of them - so this survey will really help us understand if we've got misconnections going into there or problematic assets.\" The restoration work was launched on Tuesday with a litter pick along the banks of the river at Grangemoor Park in Grangetown - 40 bags were collected - and this will continue throughout the spring.", "question": "A project to @placeholder and tackle sources of pollution on the River Ely could set a precedent for restoring other water courses across Wales , it has been claimed .", "option_0": "protect", "option_1": "build", "option_2": "identify", "option_3": "communicate", "option_4": "intervene", "label": 2}
{"article": "According to an index that tracks seasonal food, the price of Christmas dinner is now at its lowest since it started in 2009. A separate calculation suggests that Christmas trees, too, are getting cheaper, costing just an eighth of what they did back in 1975. One reason for falling prices may be the arrival of low-cost supermarkets. However, the increasing cost of importing food may mean that Christmas 2016 will mark the low point for prices. The Christmas dinner index - compiled by Good Housekeeping magazine - suggests that the 11 ingredients necessary are now 10.8% cheaper than they were in 2009. Buying everything from the turkey to Christmas pudding is likely to cost \u00a32.48 a head this year, if you bought each in the cheapest supermarket. In 2009, the equivalent cost was \u00a32.78, according to the index. Is Christmas getting cheaper? Separate research that goes back as far as 1968 comes to a similar conclusion. The figures suggest that Christmas dinner last year was the cheapest on record, at \u00a337.37 for a family of four. Back in 1975 the same dinner cost nearly \u00a355, after adjusting for inflation, according to the home interiors firm Hillarys, which compiled the research. Last year a Christmas tree cost an average of \u00a324.99, compared with the equivalent of \u00a3208 in 1975, it says. The reduction in the average cost of this year's Christmas dinner is largely down to the German supermarkets Aldi and Lidl. Buying all 11 ingredients to feed eight people will cost as little as \u00a322 at Aldi, the Christmas dinner index shows. The same ingredients would cost nearly \u00a350 at Marks and Spencer. \"While five of the supermarkets have cheaper baskets this year, it's mainly thanks to the big decrease in the cost of these groceries at Aldi and Lidl that the overall basket is significantly cheaper,\" said Caroline Bloor, the consumer director of Good Housekeeping. \"So think carefully where you shop or you could end up paying twice as much.\" But with widespread warnings about the increased cost of importing food, many shoppers may not find prices so cheap next year.

{"article": "The young star is 4,200 light-years from Earth and appears to be surrounded by a doughnut-shaped cloud of dust. That cloud slows down the hot, ionised wind that the star blasts into space, causing it to form an elongated column perpendicular to the dusty ring. The new results represent \"before and after\" glimpses of that column forming. They were captured by the Very Large Array, a battery of 27 antennae in the New Mexico desert, and are published in the journal Science. \"The comparison is remarkable,\" said first author Carlos Carrasco-Gonzalez, from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The compact, rounded wind indicated by data from 1996 transforms - just 18 years later in 2014 - into a \"distinctly elongated outflow\". The infant star is about 300 times brighter than the Sun and goes by the catchy name of W75N(B)-VLA2. Being able to observe its dramatic growing pains in real time is unique, according to Prof Huib van Langevelde from Leiden University in the Netherlands, another of the study's authors. \"This object is providing us an exciting opportunity to watch the developments over the next few years, as this very young star develops the characteristic bipolar outflow morphology,\" said Prof van Langevelde, who also works at the Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe (JIVE). VLBI - very long baseline interferometry - is the method of comparing signals between widely-spaced antennae, effectively simulating one massive telescope. One of the major findings that has already emerged from studying W75N(B)-VLA2 relates to earlier work led by JIVE scientists, who in 2009 traced the large-scale magnetic field in that region of space and reported that the field surrounding the young star was neatly aligned with it. Now, it seems the elongated outflow that has burst forth in just 18 years is also aligned with that magnetic field - suggesting that magnetism is playing a crucial role in the star's formation. The team hopes to watch and learn more as the \"protostar\" continues its turbulent development. \"Our understanding of how massive young stars develop is much less complete than our understanding of how Sun-like stars develop,\" said Dr Gabriele Surcis, another co-author from JIVE. \"It's going to be really great to be able to watch one as it changes.\"", "question": "Astronomers have witnessed a key stage in the birth of a very heavy star , using two radio telescope views of the @placeholder taken 18 years apart .", "option_0": "names", "option_1": "process", "option_2": "team", "option_3": "public", "option_4": "sea", "label": 1}

{"article": "Some might see  the claim by care home operators that there could be a \"catastrophic collapse\"  because of the higher costs associated with the National Living Wage in such a light. The residential care providers might be accused in some quarters of crying wolf after their warnings that homes might close if ministers don't agree to fund increases in the bills paid by local authorities. They have written to the Chancellor George Osborne just weeks after a similarly worded missive from the UK Homecare Association, which represents providers of social care to people in their homes. And yet... There is a sense that the latest warning letter is reflecting deeper problems in the world of social care. Care home operators have complained for some time that their finances have been severely squeezed because of cuts in real terms in the fees paid by local authorities on behalf of elderly residents. Staff wages account for about 60% of their total costs, so any pay hike will have a significant impact on each business. Increases in costs, such as higher wages, can be passed on in the shape of higher fees to residents who pay for some or all of their care. But that's not possible for places wholly funded by local authorities - which account for nearly 40% of the total at the five care home companies which wrote the letter. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The \"care calculator\" covers both residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website with news stories, analysis and video. That has led to the operators' demand that central government should provide ring-fenced funding for councils to raise their fees. The backdrop to this argument is the ageing population and the changing role of residential care homes. A few decades ago they fulfilled the role of \"retirement homes\" with mostly healthy residents. Now with the prevalence of dementia and people living longer, often with multiple conditions, care homes have a more challenging role in society. How they are resourced is an important policy issue.  The division between health, funded by central government, and social services run by local councils is widely regarded as out-dated and inappropriate for the 21st century. While NHS funding was a dominant issue in the election campaign, little was heard from national politicians about the state of social care. Labour criticised the coalition for cuts in social care funding in England over the last parliament but the argument did not seem to resonate in the same way as the repeated spats over \"billions more for the NHS\" pledges. Since polling day, a commitment to introduce reforms proposed by the commission headed by the economist Andrew Dilnot has been shelved until 2020. These included a lifetime cap on care costs, limiting an individual's liability and reducing the need to sell a family home to pay the bills. A widely praised reform plan was seen to have been postponed because of the immediate problems with social care funding. This is, of course, ultimately about the quality of life of the elderly. About 400,000 of them in England are looked after in care homes. The residential home operators are warning of closures and - even if that proves to be exaggerated - it's hard to see where the funding for improved or better quality care will come from. The response from the government to the letter has been muted. Apart from noting that the National Living Wage will benefit tens of thousands of workers in social care, a spokesperson said the funding issue would be considered in the Chancellor's spending review later this year. At a time of continued spending restraint, its difficult to identify where significant extra investment in social care will come from. As Chris Ham of the King's Fund think-tank put it on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"Unless there's a sea change between now and the spending review, the prospects for adult social care, publically funded, for the most vulnerable in society,  are pretty bleak.\"", "question": "It is easy to be cynical about companies who do business with the public @placeholder warning of dire consequences if their income is not increased .", "option_0": "lobby", "option_1": "sector", "option_2": "or", "option_3": "while", "option_4": "message", "label": 1}

{"article": "One such town, Port Hedland in Western Australia's remote Pilbara district, has seen hardship before but this time round it will be tough, according to Port Hedland Chamber of Commerce managing secretary Arnold Carter. \"Everyone is worried,\" the 87-year-old former deputy mayor told the BBC. \"Fear of the unknown is the biggest handicap. Miners won't spend when they can't see past the end of next week,\" he said. On Friday, mid-tier iron ore miner Atlas Iron announced it would mothball its operations in the remote town, 1,660 km (1,030 miles) north of Perth. Atlas employs about 500 people across its production assets and another 75 people in its Perth office. But it is more than direct jobs that are at stake, Mr Carter said. \"It goes all the way down the line to the subcontractors and where they spend their money, such as the shops in the town,\" he said. \"Those hurting the most are the small suppliers. Atlas has an army of subcontractors that supply fuel, trucks, tools, and even accommodation for the fly-in, fly-out workers. \"Thankfully, Atlas is only one of a number of projects in Port Hedland. We're hoping it doesn't get any worse.\" But by Monday, trucking group McAleese had asked the Australian Stock Exchange to suspend trading in its shares, while it considered the implications of losing its biggest customer, Atlas, and half its earnings. It had employed 400 workers and provided 100 trucks to Atlas. \"Drivers are just one set of workers who will see their cash dry up within weeks,\" said Mr Carter. \"Even people who make the meals and beds [in town] will now be sitting around without an income.\" At US$47 a tonne the price of iron ore is less than half its level year ago. It is a long way from the days when you had to pay A$2,500 (US$1,894) a week to rent a house in Port Hedland - more than some Australians earn in a month. Shareholders and owners are seeing value evaporate, too. One of the most high profile is Australian businessman and politician Clive Palmer. His prized asset, the Sino Iron project in the Pilbara, has been written down by A$2.3bn (\u00c2\u00a31.9bn; $1.7bn). Citigroup is forecasting iron ore to slide to below US$40 a tonne during the year and remain below that level for the next three years, potentially wiping out the profitability of almost every Australian iron ore miner other than the big two, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. Australian Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey has gone further, factoring in a fall to US$35 a tonne. That price would reduce budget revenue forecasts by A$25bn (\u00c2\u00a313bn; $19bn) over the next four years. It is not just Western Australia and iron ore that is feeling the downturn. The price of coal has fallen to just above US$60 per metric ton, down from US$140 four years ago and leading to the closure of mines on Australia's east coast. The fall in the price of iron and coal are linked, according to Janu Chan, Senior Economist at St George Bank. \"A downturn in the Chinese property sector means less coal for energy and iron for building are needed, adding to a glut of commodities.\" China's coal imports fell by nearly half in the first quarter of the year. ANZ Bank has forecast growth in China to fall to 7%, its slowest since 2009. \"Last year, Australia exported over A$40bn of coal, much of it to China,\" said Ms Chan. \"This year, there isn't nearly as much.\" Mr Carter has lived in Port Hedland for over half a century. He has seen some rough times in what can be a tough environment but this commodity downturn is shaking the mining industry. \"Previously, we had short-term slowdowns, and even in 2008 it was just a question of suspending construction for a while but mines carried on operating,\" he said. \"We quickly bounced back, and the boom times rolled again. \"This is the fourth downturn I've suffered but this one is different.

{"article": "Research for the British Polling Council followed the widespread failure to predict May's majority Tory win. Surveys did not accurately sample the UK population, and over-represented Labour voters, it says. The BPC has recommended a series of changes, saying pollsters may wish to randomly select participants in future. It says \"probability sampling\" may be a more accurate way of gauging voters' intentions than the current practice of recruiting people in advance to take part on the basis of their likely voting habits. The majority of polls taken during the five-week general election campaign indicated the Conservatives and Labour, led by David Cameron and Ed Miliband respectively, were neck-and-neck. This led to speculation that Labour could be the largest party in a hung parliament and could potentially have to rely on SNP support to govern. However the Conservatives secured an overall majority for the first time since 1992, winning 99 more seats than Labour, their 6.5% margin of victory taking nearly all commentators by surprise. The BPC, which represents the major survey bodies and issued an interim report into the findings in January, says the Tory win was not foreseen due to \"systemic\" errors. The inquiry said unrepresentative sampling was the primary cause for the polling failures. It cited the over-representation of Labour voters and under-representation of Tories, with Conservative voters apparently being harder to reach. There was, it added, an over-reliance on more willing survey respondents and said that too few elderly people being polled could have also played a part. It also said an inaccurate expectation of a hung parliament may have influenced the result of the election itself. The report makes 12 recommendations to the way polls are conducted in future. These include a call for measures to be taken to make sure samples are more representative, and a review into the way in which \"don't know\" voters are allocated in the results. It says BPC members should state clearly which variables were used to weight data and detail the adjustments made in between polls. BPC president John Curtice said the organisation will look to implement the report's recommendations on transparency but cannot compel members to comply with following a specific type of methodology. But he said the BPC will issue a report ahead of the general election in 2020 detailing how companies have changed their sampling and weighting procedures. \"The BPC recognises that simply saying 'well okay, it's all fine, everybody go off and do their own thing' may not be thought of as an adequate response to what happened in 2015,\" Prof Curtice said.

{"article": "However, the mass adoption of broadband in the developed world at the start of the last decade soon destroyed what was a very cosy - and highly profitable - business model. A generation has grown up illegally downloading music - and many music fans are content to use advertising-funded websites such as YouTube to hear almost any track you can think of. In 1999 the global recorded music industry raked in $26.6bn - buoyed mostly by sales of highly profitable CDs. But as pirating took off the total slipped to less than $20bn in 2007 and last year was down to just under $15bn, according to industry body IFPI. The arrival of Apple's iTunes music download store in 2003 made it much easier to legally buy music online, but its growth has stalled as more music fans switch to streaming services such as Spotify. The transition is similar to the way that many consumers now rent movies online or through subscription services such as Sky or Netflix rather than buying a DVD. Spotify's jukebox-like service lets users play millions of songs for free with ads in between, or pay \u00a34.99/$4.99 a month without those annoying interruptions. Since starting in 2006, the Swedish company now has 20 million paying subscribers and another 55 million using its free service. Aware of which way the wind is blowing, Apple this week joins the streaming bandwagon with the launch of Apple Music. It will offer users a three-month free trial, after which it will cost the same as market leader Spotify, but with no free tier. Apple Music will have a crucial advantage over the likes of competitors such as Spotify: it will be pre-loaded on the hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads being used globally via a software update. That saves Apple from having to do much marketing to promote the service, says Andrew Sheehy, lead analyst at Generator Research. Rather than aiming to make a profit from music, he says Apple's main aim is to give iPhone users another reason to keep buying its highly profitable devices. However, the company will use its might in the music business to persuade some big artists to offer some exclusive content - with Pharrell Williams being the first. His latest song, Freedom, will only be available on Apple Music. Similarly, Taylor Swift will make her music available on the service after pulling it from Spotify last year. There is no question that Apple's move into streaming will make life much harder for the likes of Spotify. Mr Sheehy predicts that up to 25% of Apple users will pay for Apple Music after the trial ends. \"The competitive dynamics are very lopsided - it's not a level playing field, but that's not to say that Spotify cannot be a success,\" he says. Tim Ingham, editor of website Music Business Worldwide, says Apple is aiming to have at least 100 million subscribers after the three-month free trial ends. He argues Apple Music should be welcomed because it will \"help remind people how exciting and integral to their lives music is\", adding: \"Apple's potential is far, far greater than what Spotify has achieved so far. Hopefully it will bring the glory days back to music.\" Mark Savage, Entertainment reporter, BBC News The new Music app has that recognisable Apple sheen - bright, colourful and slick, with much less reliance on text than its predecessor. If you've used iTunes before, it trawls your purchase history to suggest your favourite genres or artists, which swarm onto the screen in a cloud of \"bubbles\". You simply tap one to highlight a favourite, or hold it down to \"burst\" it. Those decisions power the new \"for you\" tab - which suggests music and curated playlists from iTunes' vast library (the playlists we saw ranged from \"chilling out\" to \"breaking up\"). Subscribers can stream the songs and videos they like, or download them for offline use. Elsewhere, you can browse new releases and top 10 charts, listen to Zane Lowe's new radio show, or even stream the BBC World Service. What the service lacks is a coherent social element. At launch, there are no collaborative playlists - one of Spotify's most popular features - and the \"connect\" feature, which provides status updates from your favourite artists, is no match for Tumblr, Twitter or Facebook. Apple users will enjoy the seamless integration with their current iTunes library - but with the UK pricing now confirmed to be the same as Spotify others will need more persuasion to switch than the availability of Taylor Swift's album 1989. Given the enormous marketing power Apple can deploy to promote the new service - perhaps using some of its near-$200bn cash pile to do so - will this be the end for Spotify? Not necessarily. Mr Ingham believes Spotify can be a \"very comfortable number two\" after Apple. Some investors appear to agree. Despite the imminent arrival of Apple Music, Spotify said in June that it had raised $526m (\u00a3334m) in new funding and was now valued at $8.5bn (\u00a35.4bn). That's more than household names such as Sainsbury and Royal Mail are worth. Unsurprisingly, Spotify also thinks it can survive the Apple onslaught. Mark Williamson, its head of artist services, says the company has only just \"scratched the surface\" after getting people to pay for music again. (To be fair, Apple probably deserves some of that credit for its iTunes store.) While admitting that streaming \"is not an easy business to be in\", Mr Williamson adds: \"We don't think it's going to be easy, but we're confident we can continue to innovate.\" The big challenge for Spotify is continuing to grow if it has any hope of becoming profitable. The company reported a net loss of \u20ac162m (\u00a3117m) last year - largely because its agreement with record companies and publishers requires it to pay 70% of revenues to performers and writers. Streaming is a pretty good deal for music fans - given that a monthly subscription costs little more than buying one album. Many artists, such as Ms Swift, are less certain - mainly because they get paid far less for having a song played on a streaming service than for selling a CD or an album on iTunes. Some, like her friend Ed Sheeran, are quite happy to be on Spotify because they believe the exposure helps increase sales of concert tickets. Live music is worth more than sales of recorded music in the UK. Streaming generated revenue of about $2.2bn last year, or 14.7% of the total, according to analysis of industry figures by MBW. That compares with a 46% share for physical music (that means CDs, with a tiny bit of vinyl on top) worth $6.9bn. The rest of the pie is accounted for by sales on download sites such as iTunes and royalties generated by the use of music in advertising, films and television. As Mr Ingham says, streaming is yet to capture the attention of most consumers, who might like music but will only buy a couple of CDs a year. Given that many so people - especially millennials - seem quite happy to get their music fix from YouTube, Apple might face a bigger battle to get fans paying for music than it anticipates.", "question": "If record companies had their way , the internet would never have been @placeholder .

{"article": "Now imagine the same landlord throws in a bowl of chips for free - because you are a regular at the pub three nights a week. Then the pub closes for a couple of weeks for refurbishment. So, you go to another pub - The Red Lion - a few hundred yards further down the road. A little surprisingly, the landlord at that pub knows your favourite pint too, even though you have never been in before. You find out that the Dog and Duck landlord has sold on information about your tastes to the landlord at The Red Lion. How do you feel? A bit concerned, perhaps. But worse is to come. You subsequently find out that - knowing what you are going to order - the landlord at The Red Lion has charged you 10p more than he has charged another customer. You don't even get a free bowl of chips! This might seem like a very far-fetched example. However, shift this whole buying process online - and it sums up a big issue for internet shoppers. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) wants to know more about personalised pricing. This occurs if a retailer offers different prices depending on information they have collected about that customer. This is done primarily in two ways. Firstly, retailers can collect details of a customer's previous purchases made on the website. Secondly, they can buy information about the customer's purchases or internet searches from a third party. The OFT wants to know if consumers are aware that all this data is being collected about their shopping and searching preferences, as well as if this puts consumers off buying on the internet. The regulator says that there is no evidence, but a lot of concern, that this information allows retailers to charge a higher price to certain customers - just like the hypothetical landlord at The Red Lion. \"It is important we understand what control shoppers have over their profile and whether firms are using shoppers' profiles to charge different prices for goods or services,\" says Clive Maxwell, chief executive of the OFT. Concerns have been raised about flights or hotel rates. It is alleged that in some cases, when a potential customer has looked once, then taken a few minutes to compare the cost elsewhere, they return to find the price may have risen. However, there has been no firm proof of this. Other suggestions have included different prices for people using different brands of computers, or living in different areas, as they give an indication of their wealth. Of course, such a scenario could work in a consumer's favour. A regular customer, or one the retailer would like to keep, may be offered a discount, just like the free bowl of chips in our earlier example. \"This is the transfer online of something that has been happening offline for a very long time,\" says Vanessa Barnett, partner and online marketing expert at law firm Charles Russell. The essential difference, she says, is that receiving a discount in person is much more obvious than when it is done online. She adds that consumers always have the power to withdraw their custom from the scurrilous retailer, online or offline. Technology commentator Tom Cheesewright agrees. Consumers do not like being unfairly treated because of what online retailers know about them, but they do like the discounts and better treatment that might come from the same information. So, where does this information come from anyway? Clearly, retailers can track the purchases a customer makes at their online store. In addition, websites can record information in text files called cookies. Cookies are widely used to record what repeat visitors view on a site and by advertisers to track users online. They are also used to recognise customers, make suggestions, or store their details to make the process quicker. There has been particular concern about tracking cookies, used by advertisers, which keep tabs on the various websites that you browse, so they can target you with \"relevant\" advertisements. Official statistics show that online sales were 11% higher in October than the same month a year earlier. So, this information can be very valuable indeed. Concerns about cookies have already prompted action under European law which came into force on 26 May. It requires websites to explain what cookies are and to get users' permission before using them. So, a permission request will be popping up relatively regularly at the moment for internet users. In the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) recently said that it would launch a crackdown on those not complying, although there are suggestions that many websites are failing to do so. They could face fines of up to \u00c2\u00a3500,000 each. In the US, regulators are urging internet companies to have a \"do not track\" system in place that gives consumers more control over their personal data online. In a separate development in the UK, the Department for Business has a \"midata\" programme, which encourages various banks and energy companies to release data about a customer's consumption if it is requested. Unlike online tracking, this simply keeps a note of their consumption habits of, for example, their gas and electricity. In these fields, it may allow people access to details that would help them get the most appropriate tariff. It remains to be seen whether the government will eventually legislate to encourage supermarkets to release similar data. This data is gathered on loyalty cards, which hold information about families' eating habits, when they shop, and how much they spend. At this point, the gap between data gathered by an online shopper and somebody who visits a store narrows significantly. As a result, such trends have attracted the attention of the government and the regulator. The OFT, which is working with international counterparts during its enquiries, will report in spring 2013 on whether an investigation is needed into personalised pricing. In the meantime, customers will have to rely on internet retailers acting like the landlord at the Dog and Duck.", "question": "Imagine going into your local pub - the Dog and Duck - and being greeted by the landlord who already knows your favourite tipple and @placeholder to pour it before you even reach the bar .", "option_0": "designed", "option_1": "starts", "option_2": "sought", "option_3": "chatting", "option_4": "respond", "label": 1}

{"article": "United Kingdom The numbers In the year to December 2015, an estimated total of 630,000 immigrants arrived in the UK to stay for more than a year, including 83,000 British citizens and 270,000 from other parts of the EU. An estimated 297,000 emigrated from the UK, including 123,000 British citizens and 65,000 citizens of other EU countries. The Office for National Statistics does not release a bulletin setting out the country of origin of immigrants, only the region they came from. Separate figures for National Insurance numbers issued to foreign nationals for the year ending March 2016 show how many people registered to work in the UK. The top five countries were: The top five countries for entry visas issued to non-EU nationals in the same year were: The UK's points-based system In February 2008, the Labour government introduced the UK's first points-based immigration system heralded by ministers as being based on the Australian system. It replaced a labyrinthine scheme which saw 80 different types of visa granted. The system contains a lengthy list of sub-tiers of migrant, but broadly they are classed as one of four 'tiers'. Tier 3 was intended to be a pathway for unskilled immigrants, but after the system began operating the British government decided there was no need for further unskilled immigration from outside the EU. Under the coalition, it has been removed and others tweaked so now the tiers are: Each tier offers its own allocation of points for specific 'attributes'. For each of the groups in tier 1, a person earns points according to different criteria: The admission of migrants who possess \"exceptional talent\"- that is, who are acknowledged to be world leaders in their fields - is capped at 1,000 per year, although few have taken advantage of this route so far. You must have a specific job offer in order to apply for entry under tier 2, and reach a total of 70 points. By far the easiest means of meeting that target is by having a job on the 'Shortage Occupation List', such as chief executive officer of a major company, biochemist, engineer or medical practitioner. Such an occupation earns a person 50 points, to be topped up by other factors including age and experience. Beyond the points Because the UK is a member of the European Union the points-based system only applies to people who are moving to the UK from outside the European Union. There is freedom of movement across the EU and, barring temporary restrictions for some new member states, freedom to work as well. Migrant health Paragraph 36 of the immigration rules provides that anyone planning to stay in the UK longer than six months should be referred for a medical examination, the cost of which is borne by the applicant. This is designed to ensure that no-one is admitted to the UK who might: UK Visas and Immigration currently runs a tuberculosis-testing programme for aspiring immigrants in \"high-incident countries\" and their applications are paused, pending treatment, if they test positive. Education Immigrants from outside the EU wishing to pursue higher education in the UK must satisfy several criteria. They must: Australia The numbers Australia operates two immigration schemes: the Migration Programme, which caters for economic immigrants, and the Humanitarian Programme for refugees and displaced persons. For the year 2013-14 Australia capped non-humanitarian immigrants at 190,000 - including the dependants of skilled workers. In that period Australia also welcomed approximately 20,000 people under its Humanitarian programme. The latest figures for people leaving Australia - for 2012-13 - was 91,000. The top 5 countries of origin for immigrants to Australia were: The points-based system The Australian Labor government elected in 1972 decided migrants would be granted a visa based on their personal attributes and ability to contribute to Australian society - most obviously, through their occupational status. The previous policy, which selected migrants largely on a racial and ethnic basis, was discarded. The points system - formalised in 1989 - has gone through several versions, and was most recently updated in July 2011. The Migration Programme divides available visas into two broad classes: skilled worker and employer-sponsored. Skilled-worker visas are points-tested, and to be eligible for one a person must meet a 65-point minimum. Skilled workers include professional and manual workers, with accountants and mechanics alike earning 60 points for their occupation. Those on the lower end of the scale, at 40 points, include youth workers and interior decorators. For people in a job on the skilled-worker list, points are awarded for factors including age, recognised qualifications, and previous experience working abroad. Those on employee-sponsored visas are not points-tested. Migrant health: Australia also has a health requirement for immigrants, designed to: Everyone applying for a permanent visa needs to complete a medical check, a chest x-ray (if older than 11) and HIV test (if older than 15). Only tuberculosis specifically precludes an applicant from meeting the health requirement, though even then they may resume their application after treatment. Those with other conditions are assessed by visa officers on the cost and impact of their treatment in Australian society, before a decision is made. Character test Australia has a mandatory \"character test\" for immigrants, designed to exclude anyone with a \"substantial criminal record\" or who is deemed to be a risk to the community. If someone is thought at risk of the following then they are excluded: Canada The numbers In 2013, Canada welcomed 258,619 immigrants, including economic migrants and refugees The latest figures indicate that in the same period, approximately 65,000 people left Canada. The top 5 countries of origin for immigrants to Canada were: Points-based system Canada was the first country to introduce a points-based system, in 1967. According to a report by the think-tank CentreForum, the Canadian system's distinguishing feature is that it \"prioritises broadly desirable human capital, rather than a specific job offer\". Like other countries, Canada distinguishes between skilled workers and other kinds of immigrant. Those applying for a federal skilled worker visa without a job offer are capped at 25,500, plus 1,000 each for a number of professional and technical professions. Some migrants can receive greater weighting for going to a particular territory, such as Nova Scotia. To qualify for Canadian immigration, a person has to meet a minimum of 67 points, with the maximum for each area as follows: 25 points from their educational background, 24 points from proficiency in the English and French languages, 21 points for previous work experience, 10 points for being in the prime age of employment, and up to 10 if one has an offer of employment. Financial background is also taken into consideration. Migrant health Immigrants to Canada must undergo medical examination by one of a list of physicians in their country of origin approved by the Canadian government. There are no diseases whose possession would immediately halt an application to immigrate - all cases are assessed individually. Medical inadmissibility is likely to be declared for applicants whose condition: Education Canada offers a student visa to any applicant who has:", "question": "The campaign to get Britain out of the EU has called for an Australian - @placeholder , points - based immigration system to be applied to all migrant workers - not just those from outside the EU .

It is the latest in a series of missile-related tests this year. Meanwhile, the US and China have agreed to step up co-operation at the UN to address the North's fifth nuclear test. The underground nuclear test, conducted earlier this month, is thought to be the country's most powerful yet. North Korea regularly makes claims about the progress of its nuclear and missile programmes, but analysts say most of them are impossible to independently verify. US and Chinese officials have started discussions on a possible UN sanctions resolution as a response, unnamed diplomats were quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. But Beijing has not said directly whether it will support tougher steps against Pyongyang, the agency added. China is North Korea's main ally and trading partner, but has grown increasingly intolerant of its military actions and Kim Jong-un's aggressive rhetoric. Its support for toughened sanctions is crucial if they are to have any impact, but Beijing has repeatedly said that such steps are not the ultimate answer for the issue. Kim Jong-un supervised the test at the country's Sohae satellite-launching site, KCNA reported. That is where the country launched a rocket in February, reportedly carrying a satellite. The engine tested would give the country \"sufficient carrier capability for launching various kinds of satellites, including Earth observation satellite at a world level\", the report added. Mr Kim, KCNA said, called for more rocket launches to turn the country into a \"possessor of geostationary satellites in a couple of years to come.\" This was seen by observers as an indication that Pyongyang might soon launch another long-range rocket.

{"article": "Where could the Liberal Democrats make a resurgence? Where might Labour and the Conservatives lock horns? Where is Plaid Cymru in play, and what kind of role will independent councillors have in this election? Here are some of the authorities where these questions will come to the fore as the results roll in on 5 May. Can Labour hold on to the largest authority by population served in Wales? Can Jeremy Corbyn's leadership prove to be an asset rather than a liability in Wales' metropolitan capital? The risk for the party is that it is hit on three sides by the opposition groups - with the Liberal Democrats stronger in the centre of the city, the Tories stronger in the north and Plaid in the west. Can Labour fend that off and retain control, or will they lose out to rival parties on 4 May? It regained control of the capital at the last elections in 2012 from a Lib Dem-Plaid Cymru coalition. Since then the Labour group has been hit by internal rows - largely based along personality lines - and there has been a change in leader since the last election. By-elections and quitting councillors have also contributed to its majority being shaved from 17 to six over the course of the term. There are currently 39 Labour councillors, with 17 Lib Dems, 9 Conservatives, 5 Plaid Cymru and two independents. There are 75 Labour candidates, 75 from the Liberal Democrats, 59 in Plaid Cymru, 75 Conservatives, 14 Greens, 12 UKIP candidates, 5 independents and 17 others. This west Wales council has historically been a good example of a Labour/Plaid Cymru tussle with a significant independent presence. At the last election Plaid lost two seats overall, while Labour gained 12. Labour led a coalition with independents until 2015 when a coalition of Plaid Cymru and independent councillors took control. The authority has been in the news in recent years, with controversy over the pay of chief executive Mark James, and a libel case also involving the senior officer. Plaid Cymru, which is fielding the most number of candidates at 66, will want to boost its numbers and retain leadership of the authority. Labour will, naturally, want it back. And how will independent numbers affect who eventually takes the helm? The authority currently has 29 Plaid Cymru councillors, 22 Labour and 20 classed as independent, two classed as independent unaffiliated and one classed as People First. Plaid Cymru has 66 candidates, while Labour has 54. There are 52 independents running, as well as 21 Conservatives, 12 UKIP candidates, six Lib Dems, one Green and two others. Four seats, where the numbers of candidates nominated mean there is no competition in the wards concerned, will be uncontested. Independents play a big role in local government in Wales. There have a large presence in many of Wales' authorities, including Wrexham, where they are in control. That only happened after Labour lost control of the authority, however, with ten Labour councillors quitting the party group in 2014. With a highly-charged general election campaign taking place at the same time, can independents in Wales make their voices heard? Can the Conservatives, who are tipped in the north east for general election gains and have a role within the ruling administration, make gains in Wrexham? And can Labour recover lost ground or Plaid make any headway? Wrexham currently has 20 independents, 12 Labour, five Conservatives, five Liberal Democrats, eight in the Wrexham Independent group and two Plaid Cymru councillors. For the election there are 62 independents standing, 39 Labour candidates, 20 Conservatives, 15 Plaid Cymru, 13 Liberal Democrats, three UKIP, two Greens and two others. Three seats will be uncontested. Swansea was one of the authorities Labour won control of at the 2012 council elections. But could it be an authority that serves as an opinion poll ahead of the general election the month later? This time Labour's 72 candidates will be facing 70 from the Conservatives, in an election that comes two years after the latter party's shock general election victory in Gower. Can Swansea county Tories solidify that gain by winning seats in the area, despite the fact that the party has few councillors currently? Labour won the authority from a Liberal Democrat-led coalition, when the Lib Dems lost 10 seats. Can the party make a re-bound? At present Labour has 47 councillors, versus 11 Liberal Democrats, four independents, three Conservatives, three in the Independents@Swansea group, two non-aligned and two others. Labour are fielding 72 candidates in Swansea, versus 70 from the Tories, 25 from the Lib Dems, 17 from Plaid Cymru, 11 independents, eight Greens, seven UKIP and 17 others. If the council elections are going to be any kind of indication of how the parties might do ahead of the snap election in May, it will be authorities like Bridgend that we will be keeping an eye on. It is here, at Brackla Community Centre, where the prime minister took her general election campaign to Wales. Theresa May was parking her Tory tanks on Labour's lawn, in the backyard of First Minister Carwyn Jones, and the Tories have been eyeing the seat for some time. The irony is that the Conservatives are only fielding 36 candidates, although that is more than any other party except Labour. If the Tories fail to get many councillors elected, will that be any indication of how the party may do in June - and will Mrs May's visit begin to look overly optimistic? Or will Labour voters stick with the party for the locals, and go elsewhere for Westminster? Labour currently has 31 Labour councillors, with 16 independents, three Liberal Democrats, one Conservative and one Plaid Cymru member. Labour is standing 54 candidates, against 52 independents, 36 from the Conservatives, 18 Plaid Cymru, six from the Liberal Democrats, four in the Greens, one UKIP and two others. Most but not all councils count overnight. Nine out of the 22 will not start full counts until the next day.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device In a moment of heartache at Vicarage Road, where their hopes of winning promotion were dramatically ended by Watford last term, the Foxes' path had already well and truly been set. Eleven players who lined up against the Hornets last May were on hand to help finish the job 10 months later as Leicester beat Sheffield Wednesday - a victory that ultimately proved enough to secure their top-flight status with six matches remaining. Pearson and his team gave BBC Late Kick Off Midlands an all-access pass for an exclusive insight into the side's evolution from the nearly-men of 2013, to head of the class in 2014. \"If everyone improves by a couple of percent, it very quickly adds ups. That is really what it's about,\" said Pearson. In a term made famous by Great Britain's incredibly successful Olympic track cycling team at London 2012, 'marginal gains' has become the mantra adopted at City's Belvoir Drive training ground. The results are the riches of the Premier League and a 21-game unbeaten run that has taken them there. But it all starts with the team behind the team - from Pearson's management staff, scouts, match analysts, sports scientists, strength and conditioning coaches, physiotherapists and nutritionist. \"We are all trying to work towards the same thing,\" said Pearson. \"The margins of error are very, very small and it's becoming even more of a fine line between success and failure. \"We have experienced the highs and lows in the last 13 months - it is difficult to quantify the work you do, but ultimately we are trying to improve on every level we can. \"I am fortunate and very privileged to work with a lot of people who are experts in their own field, and their attention to details in contributing to results is valued by myself and the players.\" For all the tactics mapped out in Pearson's office, weights lifted in the gym, drills run on training ground and match footage edited this season, the whole plan was masterminded in a Shropshire pub last May. City's head physiotherapist Dave Rennie, who has been with the club for 15 years and worked under 20 different managers, said a pint of beer seemed like the logical place to start after getting to within two wins of promotion. \"We are British and went to the pub, so we had two days at Nigel's father in-laws pub in Shropshire which was fabulous from what I can remember,\" said Rennie. Seconds after Leicester City's Anthony Knockaert had a penalty saved at one end, Troy Deeney sealed Watford's aggregate win in an extraordinary finish to their play-off semi-final in May. \"It proved a non-threatening environment for us to talk as a group of people. It was at that point that we went away as staff and de-briefed the positives from the season and discussed where we really needed to go in terms of changing the philosophy a little bit more. \"We were almost at a level where we thought things were right, but there were little areas we thought we could improve.\" With match analysis software uploaded to tablet computers, development has been hardwired into the Foxes. No moment or yard is unaccounted with players plugged in the instant they arrive at Belvoir Drive, as every player studies their previous performance before being hooked up to a GPS system and heart monitor. \"I'm preparing for training whilst watching my game at the weekend, so it gives me the opportunity to watch while I keep working,\" midfielder Matty James said. \"Attention to detail has played a key part throughout this season.\" In a season where Leicester saw no reason to fix what was not broken, shrewd transfer dealing has still proven crucial. Assistant manager and head of recruitment Steve Walsh - who had an 18-year association with Chelsea as a scout and worked with Jose Mourinho before leaving in 2006 - saw reason to sign 33-year-old Poland international Marcin Wasilewski, despite the player having suffered a horrendous broken leg while playing in Belgium in 2009. \"He had a difficult time, had that double leg break, but we did some research on how he had got back,\" said Walsh. \"We asked him if he could come in so we could have a look at him on trial. Media playback is not supported on this device \"This is a player with 60 caps for Poland and once we brought him in we could see that.

Rennie had already seen Pearson come and go, guiding City to promotion from League One in 2008-09 then to the Championship play-offs the following campaign in a successful first spell. Two managerial appointments later, including the big-spending reign of Sven-Goran Eriksson, and Pearson was back at the King Power Stadium. \"We have seen lots of different management styles, we have to roll with a few and duck a few others,\" said Rennie. \"That is football and can be very unsettling - Nigel has provided us with a good period of stability. \"He is very very innovative, what he is clever at doing is utilising the other member of staff.

The data suggests the US has shrugged off the slow start to the year when heavy snow saw the economy shrink. \"The question of whether the economy is accelerating or will accelerate is no longer a question; we can say somewhat definitively that the economy has already accelerated,\" said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG. Meanwhile, a separate survey, showed US house prices rose by more than expected in September. The closely-watched S&P/Case Shiller index jumped 4.9% year-on-year. The index, which measures single-family home prices in 20 cities, showed that prices were up 0.3% month-on-month on a seasonally adjusted basis. \"With the economy looking better than a year ago, the housing outlook for 2015 is stable to slightly better,\" said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Capital Economics economist Paul Dales said the strong GDP upgrade underlined his expectation that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as soon as March next year. \"Most people were expecting a downward revision so this was a real surprise,\" he added. At the end of October, the US Federal Reserve said it would not raise interest rates for a \"considerable time\". It also ended its quantitative easing (QE) stimulus programme of buying financial assets and creating new money to pay for them, aimed at stimulating the economy.

{"article": "Director David Cronenberg attempted to revive the franchise in 2011, but 20th Century Fox passed on the project. An earlier sequel starring Eric Stoltz was critically panned in 1989, but Goldblum said he would like to see a new version created by Cronenberg. He told the BBC \"new technology\" would allow the director to \"do whatever he wants to with some other Fly story\". \"It was kind of primitive back in '86/'87 - I'd be interested in seeing it.\" Goldblum starred as scientist Seth Brundle in The Fly, who turns into a giant insect after one of his experiments goes terribly wrong. The 1989 sequel saw Stoltz as Brundle's son searching for a cure to his mutated genes. 'Budget problem' Cronenberg, who was not part of the second film, first talked about writing a new version of the film back in 2009 and confirmed in 2011 he had written a script. Shortly after, he revealed 20th Century Fox was not interested and later explained it was \"a budget problem\". Goldblum said he was keen to team up with Cronenberg again, as he \"was satisfied with the very nourishing collaboration we had, but it would be dreamy to work with him\". \"I'd like to see anything he did really,\" he said. The actor is currently starring in another sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence, which picks up 20 years after the blockbuster hit. It sees Goldblum reprise his role as David Levinson, who is now in charge of Earth's space defences following the alien invasion of the first film. Liam Hemsworth also stars in the movie, with many of the original's cast returning including Bill Pullman, Vivica Fox and Brent Spiner. Independence Day took more than $800m (\u00c2\u00a3545.6m) globally when it was released in 1996, but Goldblum said the new film was not an attempt to cash in on that success. \"All the creators were highly respectful of the audience that enjoyed the first one so much and shelled out their hard-earned money,\" he said. \"I don't think they wanted to do something just to exploit that interest and make them buy another ticket - I think they really wanted to satisfy them and felt a responsibility. \"I know [director] Roland [Emmerich] was not particularly excited about sequels in general. \"The first one was meant to be a stand-alone movie and he brought himself around to be passionate about it for its own reason - but not because it's a sequel. \"He tried to be as creative and original as he could.\" Independence Day: Resurgence is released in UK cinemas on 23 June.", "question": "Film star Jeff Goldblum has said he would be interested in another sequel to his hit 1986 @placeholder movie The Fly .", "option_0": "form", "option_1": "side", "option_2": "horror", "option_3": "comments", "option_4": "team", "label": 2}

{"article": "Back in the folds of those hills, and by the lakes with the trees in all their brilliant Fall glory and the next snows not far away, the campaign feels strangely familiar. Clinton still trying to escape from the miasma of emails and old stories that she has not been able to expunge and Trump still hoping to persuade Americans who have thought him too egocentric and coarse to be president that he has substance after all. In this corner of New England - a state with a population of only 1.2 million - that struggle could be decided. They are locked together, and alongside their contest is one of the half dozen races that will settle control of the Senate in Washington and therefore much of the character of the next few years. Listening at a student rally to Bernie Sanders, who beat Clinton in the Democratic primary here, was to hear again the rallying hymn that did energise a liberal movement and which, in recent days, has seemed to lose some of its confidence. He attacked big money, corporate interests, and was cheered to the echo when he said that under a Clinton administration, billionaires (guess who?) would pay their fair share of taxes. But in the wings you could hear the worries of Democrats who thought a month ago that the campaign had a momentum that would certainly carry them home. One confessed that it was sometimes difficult to persuade even friendly voters on the doorstep that the \"Hillary stuff\"  was a messy mistake and not a scandal. It is tough for the Clinton campaign in these last few days. But don't imagine that because Trump has made ground in the last week, with the surprising help of the FBI director's intervention, that he is sailing happily along. In New Hampshire, his party remains split. And even the Union Leader, a paper famous as a populist noticeboard of the Right, remains opposed to him, urging voters to opt for the libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, instead. The publisher, Joe McQuaid, told me that Trump was certainly a force of nature, but that you had to remember that there were bad forces in nature as well as good ones. He spoke of Trump's efforts to persuade him to come on board, when the full ego was on display and he \"sucked the air out of the room\", and his own refusal to join the bandwagon. In his office, a photograph from one of Trump's visits to work on him now hangs on his bathroom door. These are candidates who haven't managed to escape from themselves. Clinton still disturbs some voters who might be expected to rally to the Democrat cause without question, and Trump has shed many long-time Republicans along the way. John Kasich, powerful governor of Ohio, announced his week that he had voted early - and written in the name of Senator John McCain on his ballot paper instead of voting for Trump. Write any name on ballot - it counts But perhaps, despite the spectacle of this campaign which has dismayed so many voters because of its tone, none of this is surprising. America is a deeply divided country and the election, rather accurately, demonstrates the fact. Take one of the great issues that lurks just under the surface - the future of the Supreme Court. Nothing divides the candidates more profoundly. Matt Mayberry, vice-chairman of the state Republican party, told me how energised his voters were by the prospect of Clinton appointees moving the Court sharply in a liberal direction in the next four years. They believe profoundly in stopping that, as much as they believe in Trump's message of smaller government, tougher immigration laws, lower taxes. I heard the same point put the other way round, with equal passion, by Ray Buckley, state Democratic chairman. Each side sees it as a defining question for the electorate and the country. The course set by the next appointments - made by the president and put to the Senate for approval - will have huge implications for social policy in the next generation. That's one of the reasons why this contest, which so many Americans have found tawdry and depressing, is so important. And why the two candidates, in the next few days, are trying to find a style and tone that will persuade their doubters to put their fears aside. Two weeks ago it looked as if Clinton had much the easier task, and it's still true that the state-by-state arithmetic of the electoral college seems to favour her. But Trump has once again bulldozed his way through. The passion you'll hear and feel from the candidates over the next few days is not just part of the ritual. It's real. Their performance at the climax of this bizarre campaign will decide how many waverers turn their way, and therefore the direction of their country.", "question": "As it began , so it ends .

Traditionally the NHS has focused on advising smokers to give up completely. But this proposal, which covers England, is an acknowledgement that for some a softer approach is needed.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device The 47-year-old Las Vegan began working with Djokovic via phone calls to Madrid and Rome last month, and took up coaching duties in person last week in Paris. There is no clear idea yet of how long the relationship will last. \"That's a question for him, to be honest,\" was all Djokovic would say on the subject before the tournament. What we do know is that Agassi is scheduled to leave Paris at the end of the first week to carry out prior engagements, and there is no clue yet as to when, or if, he will be back in Team Djokovic. \"I will be very surprised if this relationship is going over the US Open,\" said Fabrice Santoro, a former rival of Agassi now commentating at Roland Garros. \"I think it's going to be a very short relation between Andre and Novak,\" the Frenchman told BBC Radio 5 live. \"Andre Agassi knows the game very well, he loves the game, he likes Novak, but it's not his life at the moment. \"He has his own life at home with his foundation, with his family, and I'm not sure he's happy to spend much time in the locker room.\" It was in Paris 12 months ago that Djokovic finally cemented his place among the very best by completing the career Grand Slam, and holding all four major titles at once - something that has eluded Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. But with 12 Grand Slam titles to his name and seemingly set to dominate for the foreseeable future, the Serb's form deserted him. \"I think Novak needs to be back as a warrior, like he was a few months ago,\" said Santoro. \"It's not like 10 years ago - when he won the French Open last year he was not giving one free point to the opponent, he was sliding all over Paris to win a point. You could see in his eyes how big his ambition was. He's lost that.\" \"Private issues\" contributed to Djokovic's early exit at Wimbledon, he later revealed, while a wrist injury curbed hopes of a quick return to form. But by his own remarkable standards, the fact that he has since lost his grip on three of those Slams and seen the number one ranking go to Andy Murray is little short of a disaster. \"Shock therapy\" was what he felt necessary, and it came with the surprise announcement late last year that he was parting ways not only with 'super coach' Boris Becker after three years, but his entire team, including long-time coach and confidante Marian Vajda. \"All these beautiful memories we shared with each other on and off the court cannot be forgotten just like that,\" said Djokovic. \"We are still very close.\" Djokovic won six Grand Slam titles over three years with Becker, and all 12 since starting work with Vajda in 2006. The Serb's employment of Becker in 2013 was seen by many as a response to the success Andy Murray had after taking on another legend of the past in Ivan Lendl. But even in his current, second coaching spell, Lendl is likely to spend up to 18 weeks of the year working with Murray, with Jamie Delgado alongside the Scot throughout the season. \"I think Andre Agassi's help could be enough if Marian Vajda was still there, but he's not,\" Santoro said of the fledgling Djokovic arrangement. \"So Novak needs someone to replace Vajda first, and then find a super coach like Andre. \"I know that if Andy Murray was travelling only a few weeks a year with Ivan Lendl, but without Jamie Delgado, he would be in trouble. This is the situation now with Novak.\" Murray himself was a huge Agassi fan growing up and once discussed working with the American, but it never came to a formal offer. \"He was always really, really nice to me, which is great,\" said Murray. \"I'm sure he'll help Novak as well. I'm not sure exactly what their deal is or the situation is, but having someone with that much experience around can only help.\" Djokovic is currently just working with his brother, Marko, a former professional but with no coaching credentials, and Pepe Imaz, a former world number 146 who now runs a tennis academy that preaches a philosophy of love, peace and meditation. \"I'm not convinced that this person helps Novak Djokovic a lot,\" said Santoro. \"Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right. On court, for sure not.\" For all the scrutiny that his relationship with Imaz has come under, the lack of a settled fitness trainer and physio is incongruous for a player who wrote a book on the value of physical and mental well-being. \"I have certain people and methods that I have been trying out lately,\" said Djokovic on Monday. \"I am working on something, for sure, but still not ready to be shared.\" So what can Agassi bring that will rejuvenate and enhance the Djokovic game? Djokovic turned 30 a few weeks ago, and Agassi won two of his eight Grand Slam titles in his 30s. He also returned from the depths of 141 in the world in 1997 to regain the number one spot and complete the career Grand Slam in 1999 - a mountainous challenge compared to Djokovic's relatively minor slide. Technical changes are rarely the major issue when elite players call upon greats of the past, and Djokovic is sure to look more for emotional support from Agassi, with neither man averse to a bout of introspection. \"On the first day we had two practice sessions, and then we had a very, very long conversation in the evening,\" the Serb said of their first day together in Paris. Becker, the man who used to provide that support, gave Agassi a very public welcome to the role in the stands of Philippe Chatrier Court during Djokovic's opening match at the French Open. \"I think it's an excellent choice,\" Becker told the BBC. \"Andre's personality fits with Novak's. \"Ideally you don't want to start a new relationship at a Grand Slam because you have to get to know each other but that was their decision, so I wish them luck. \"Ideally you have to spend a lot of time together - even in smaller tournaments to really get to know each other and trust each other - but it is what it is and hopefully successful.\"", "question": "Andre Agassi has @placeholder as many camera lenses as Novak Djokovic in the opening days of this year 's French Open , but the question remains whether this is a fleeting glimpse or the long - term return of one of the game 's greats .", "option_0": "resigned", "option_1": "dismissed", "option_2": "utilized", "option_3": "starred", "option_4": "attracted", "label": 4}

{"article": "In a study,             published in Nature , they prevented brain cells dying in mice with prion disease. It is hoped the same method for preventing brain cell death could apply in other diseases. The findings are at an early stage, but have been heralded as \"fascinating\". Many neuro-degenerative diseases result in the build-up of proteins which are not put together correctly - known as misfolded proteins. This happens in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's as well as in prion diseases, such as the human form of mad cow disease. Researchers at the University of Leicester uncovered how the build-up of proteins in mice with prion disease resulted in brain cells dying. They showed that as misfolded protein levels rise in the brain, cells respond by trying to shut down the production of all new proteins. It is the same trick cells use when infected with a virus. Stopping production of proteins stops the virus spreading. However, shutting down the factory for a long period of time ends up killing the brain cells as they do not produce the proteins they actually need to function. The team at the Medical Research Council laboratory in Leicester then tried to manipulate the switch which turned the protein factory off. When they prevented cells from shutting down, they prevented the brain dying. The mice then lived significantly longer. Each neuro-degenerative disease results in a unique set of misfolded proteins being produced, which are then thought to lead to brain cells dying. Prof Giovanna Mallucci told the BBC: \"The novelty here is we're just targeting the protein shut-down, we're ignoring the prion protein and that's what makes it potentially relevant across the board.\" The idea, which has not yet been tested, is that if preventing the shut down protects the brain in prion disease - it might work in all diseases that have misfolded proteins. Prof Mallucci added: \"What it gives you is an appealing concept that one pathway and therefore one treatment could have benefits across a range of disorders. \"But the idea is in its early stages. We would really need to confirm this concept in other diseases.\" The study has been broadly welcomed by other scientists although many point out that the research is in its infancy. Professor of Molecular Neurobiology at King's College London, Roger Morris, said it was a \"breakthrough in understanding what kills neurons\". He added: \"There are good reasons for believing this response, identified with prion disease, applies also to Alzheimer's and other neuro-degenerative diseases. \"And because it is such a general response, we already have some drugs that inhibit this response.\" Prof Andy Randall, from the University of Bristol, said: \"This is a fascinating piece of work. \"It will be interesting to see if similar processes occur in some of the common diseases with such deposits, for example Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. \"Furthermore, if this is the case, can modulating this same pathway be a route to new therapeutic approaches in these more prevalent conditions that afflict many millions of sufferers around the world? Ultimately only more research will tell us this.\" Dr Eric Karran, the director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"The findings present the appealing concept that one treatment could have benefits for a range of different diseases; however the idea is in its early stages. \"The research focuses on the effects of the prion protein and we would need to see the same results confirmed in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's to really strengthen the evidence.\"", "question": "The tantalising prospect of treating a range of brain diseases , such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's , all with the same drug , has been @placeholder by UK researchers .", "option_0": "suggested", "option_1": "signed", "option_2": "raised", "option_3": "launched", "option_4": "published", "label": 2}

Earlier this week Pyongyang announced it was planning to launch a satellite at some point in February.

UN sanctions against North Korea prohibit it from carrying out any nuclear or ballistic missile tests. North Korea's missile programme How potent are the threats? Isolated country's nuclear tests A world leader in dramatic rhetoric South Korean state news agency Yonhap reported defence ministry officials on Thursday as saying activity had been spotted at a site in Dongchang-ri, where the Sohae launching station is located. Defence Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun also said the South's military was ramping up its air defence readiness so it was ready to intercept any missile or debris falling in its territory. The South has already ordered certain commercial flights to divert their routes. Japan's national broadcaster NHK, citing unnamed officials, also reported similar news about activity at Dongchang-ri, and added that a mobile launcher carrying a ballistic missile had also been seen moving near the east coast. Separately, South Korean President Park Geun-hye said in a statement reported by Yonhap that any long-range missile launch by the North \"should never be condoned as it poses a threat to peace on the Korean Peninsula and the world\". She said the move was \"a desperate measure\" by the North to maintain its regime, and showed Pyongyang was not afraid of UN sanctions. The US-based North Korean analysis website 38 North said recent satellite images show recent activity at Sohae suggesting launch preparations. These include heightened activity at a building used to receive rocket stages, and a complex that appears ready to conduct engine tests. North Korean state news agency KCNA reported on Thursday that the ruling Workers' Party of Korea was holding a meeting among central and army committee members where they discussed how to \"further strengthen\" the party ahead of a rare political meeting scheduled for May. Analysts say the North's recent nuclear and missile activity could be a build-up to the upcoming seventh party congress - the first to be held since 1980 - where leader Kim Jong-un is expected to show off the nuclear programme. North Korea had told the UN agency International Maritime Organization earlier this week that it plans to launch a satellite between 8 and 25 February. The move sparked intense warnings and criticism from South Korea, Japan, Russia and the United States. South Korea has warned a \"severe price\" will be paid if the North goes ahead. Pyongyang's main ally, China, has called on the North to \"exercise restraint, act with discretion and refrain from any actions\" that might escalate tensions.", "question": "North Korea appears to be preparing to launch a long - range missile , according to South Korea 's defence ministry and Japanese @placeholder .", "option_0": "office", "option_1": "media", "option_2": "bodies", "option_3": "military", "option_4": "government", "label": 1}
{"article": "Mourinho could not afford any mistakes in this third-round tie after Premier League defeats by Manchester City and Watford, with a Europa League loss to Feyenoord sandwiched in between. It was eventually smooth passage, assisted by Northampton keeper Adam Smith, who endured a nightmare evening and played a big part in two of United's goals. The highly rated 23-year-old picked up a back pass in the 17th minute and when Wayne Rooney's resulting free-kick was blocked, the recalled Michael Carrick fired home the loose ball emphatically. Alex Revell gave the Cobblers hope of a shock from the penalty spot just before half-time after Daley Blind fouled Sam Hoskins - but this was not the night for an upset. United regrouped and Ander Herrera's powerful drive put them in front after 68 minutes before Smith's misery was complete seven minutes later when he missed a simple long clearance to allow substitute Marcus Rashford to roll the ball into an empty net. Relive Wednesday's EFL Cup action Jose Mourinho has been reluctant to use the 35-year-old England midfield man since his arrival at Old Trafford. This was his first start since Manchester United's win against Leicester City in the Community Shield at Wembley. On this evidence he surely has a strong case to force his way into Mourinho's plans - not least because he possesses the style and composure to bring the best from United's \u00a389m world record signing Paul Pogba. Pogba has looked restricted in his early performances and the selection of Carrick, so reliable in possession and even chipping in with a goal here, would allow the France midfield man freedom, play to his strengths and give him the opportunity to do damage further forward. Carrick's experience and expert reading of the game adds to Mourinho's options and could finally bring the best from his showpiece summer signing. Surely he will start against Leicester City at Old Trafford on Saturday. As Pogba got the night off and Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Rashford started on the bench with Mourinho making nine changes from United's 3-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road, there was no respite for Rooney. United's embattled captain, who has bore the brunt of much of the criticism aimed at the side this season, was in the starting line-up but endured another night of frustration. He worked hard but nothing is coming off for the 30-year-old. He missed one easy chance early on and when he did hit the target after Timothy Fosu-Mensah's header hit the bar, he was adjudged offside. With Carrick and Herrera excelling and with a host of attacking options available to Mourinho, will Rooney's place come under threat against Leicester City at Old Trafford at the weekend? Northampton may not have been able to spring the big shock and increase the woes for Mourinho by knocking Manchester United out of the EFL Cup - but there was still plenty for the club lying 11th in League One to be pleased about. The neat Sixfields stadium was packed with a record crowd of 7,798. With a new stand in the process of being built, the club can be proud of the way it handled the big occasion. Northampton's 31-game unbeaten run ended with defeat by Chesterfield on Saturday and for spells they showed United too much respect. This is, perhaps, understandable, but this was a night when Northampton as a club did itself great credit. If there was a sadness, it was the disappointment suffered by keeper Smith, who has attracted Premier League attention but was badly at fault here. Smith was included in the League Two team of the season as the Cobblers clinched the title in the previous campaign. There will be better days ahead for a talented young goalkeeper. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho: \"It was as difficult as I was expecting but we looked to be in control for the first 35 minutes and then we looked to be in control for the last 45. I think the team was in control from the beginning and the subs were just a contribution. \"The game should be easier, we should have been playing against 10 men very early in the second half. Northampton fought and they tried to cause us problems which sometimes they did but it was a positive performance overall. \"I don't like to individualise the players, I think it was fine, the midfield were in control.\" Northampton manager Rob Page: \"When you get back in to it at 1-1 you never know. \"I'm really proud of the players, we had to be disciplined. They've had a tough week by their standards but we knew we had to be strong. When you give away soft goals you will get punished. \"He (goalkeeper Adam Smith) was outstanding last season and he'll bounce back from this. He's a strong character, we've all had moments like that as players.\" Match ends, Northampton Town 1, Manchester United 3. Second Half ends, Northampton Town 1, Manchester United 3. Attempt missed.

{"article": "Lee James, 24, killed Bijan Ebrahimi and set fire to his body in the Brislington area of Bristol in July. Mr Justice Simon ordered that James must serve a minimum of 18 years in prison. Bristol Crown Court heard Mr Ebrahimi, who was an Iranian national and in his 40s, died from head injuries. Stephen Norley, 25, who had admitted assisting an offender, was given a four-year jail term. He helped James drag Mr Ebrahimi's body from the scene of the attack and obtained white spirit to burn the body. His remains were found 100m from his maisonette in Capgrave Crescent. Mr Ebrahimi was murdered on 14 July, three days after he was arrested by police following complaints that he had been taking pictures of children near his home. Officers examined his camera, videos and computer but found nothing suspicious and he was released without charge. The night before the killing Mr Ebrahimi recorded video of James holding a beer can and shouting at him after realising he was being filmed. Jurors were shown the video. In sentencing the pair, who both lived near the victim, the judge described the murder as \"deeply shocking\". He said it was \"a vigilante crime\" and \"an act of murderous injustice\", adding that claims that Mr Ebrahimi was a paedophile were baseless. Speaking after the sentencing, Mr Ebrahimi's sister, Manisha Moores, said: \"The next question to be answered is whether Bijan's death could have been avoided if he received the proper protection he deserved from the authorities. \"Lessons must be learned before other vulnerable lives are lost.\" Prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC said neighbours witnessed the doorstep confrontation between James and Mr Ebrahimi. He said: \"Lee James was shouting at Mr Ebrahimi, telling him in abusive terms to stop taking pictures, to give him the camera, to delete the photographs. \"Mr James himself told one of the witnesses that Mr Ebrahimi had taken pictures of him with a can of beer in his hand. \"Mr Powell remembers Mr James saying 'I am going to burn his house down'. \"At one point Mr James entered Mr Ebrahimi's home uninvited and remonstrated with him and threatened him.\" The court heard that during the fatal attack James repeatedly stamped on Mr Ebrahimi's head, shouting \"have some of that\". Mr Langdon said that after murdering Mr Ebrahimi and burning his body, James told his girlfriend: \"We sorted him out. We took care of things.\" James, also of Capgrave Crescent, told police he had kicked Mr Ebrahimi \"like a football... I had so much anger in me\". The court heard Mr Ebrahimi, who moved to the UK in 2001, made several calls to police in the 48 hours before his murder, but \"those calls were not responded to\". Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan issued an apology after the tragedy, saying: \"Mr Ebrahimi was someone who deserved the protection of all of us and we are very sorry about what happened to him.\" The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has interviewed six police officers and six civilian staff as part of their investigation into police contact prior to Mr Ebrahimi's death. Three constables have been questioned over potential misconduct in public office. An inspector, sergeant, constable, control room supervisor, dispatcher and four call handlers have been interviewed for gross misconduct. The inspector is no longer subject to the investigation. Mr Gargan said: \"On the day of Mr Ebrahimi's murder, we knew enough about the police response to convince us that we should make an immediate referral to the IPCC. \"We still await their report and therefore it is not appropriate for me to say more about that police response. It's important that we don't affect that external scrutiny by expressing a public opinion. \"It could also be the case that criminal proceedings follow and if so a jury needs to reach its verdict based on evidence in the courtroom, not our opinion today. \"Nevertheless... it is clear that there was a collective failure on the part of statutory agencies and others to protect Mr Ebrahimi. \"We need to have some frank and candid local discussions with our partners and our communities about what we collectively can do to stop this happening again. \"Senior people in our own organisation have already put in place urgent actions to improve the way we respond to the vulnerable, handle reports of anti-social behaviour and identify repeat callers and victims and we will continue to talk to partners to improve the way we work together to protect the public.\" Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens said: \"The tragic murder of Mr Ebrahimi has shocked and saddened me and I have critical questions for the police and other agencies about the events leading up to Mr Ebrahimi's death. \"While I am not going to draw any conclusions before the IPCC investigation and any other reviews are complete I am determined to look publicly at what could or should have been done differently.\" The IPCC report and a report by the Safer Bristol Partnership are expected to be completed and made public early next year.", "question": "A man has been jailed for life after admitting he murdered his disabled neighbour who had been wrongly @placeholder a paedophile .", "option_0": "stabbed", "option_1": "struck", "option_2": "plotted", "option_3": "assaulted", "option_4": "branded", "label": 4}
{"article": "It appears likely the decommissioned craft came down between 03:23 and 05:09 GMT - with a best estimate of 04:16. If correct, this means any debris that survived to the surface probably went into water and not on land. The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) is the largest American space agency satellite to return uncontrolled into the atmosphere in about 30 years. The fall to Earth was monitored by the Joint Space Operations Center (JSPOC) at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Its best estimate for the timing of the re-entry would have seen UARS come in at a point well out into the North Pacific. However, if UARS re-entered many minutes after 04:16, it is possible debris could have reached the American landmass. There were some unconfirmed reports of glowing wreckage moving across the sky in western Canada, but Nasa said it had yet to receive credible evidence that this was so, less still that any debris items had been found. \"I've got no reports that I've seen that talk about people who think they might have recovered debris,\" Nick Johnson, Nasa's chief scientist for orbital debris at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, told reporters during a media teleconference. \"Obviously, we're going to continue to keep our eyes and ears open, and if we receive any reports like that we'll try to go verify.\" Most of the 20-year-old satellite should simply have burnt up on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, but modelling work indicated perhaps 500kg could have survived to the surface. Calculations estimated this material would have been scattered over an 800km path. Nonetheless, with more than 70% of the Earth's surface covered by water, many experts had offered the view in recent weeks that an ocean grave was going to be the most probable outcome for UARS. \"Because we don't know where the re-entry point actually was, we don't know where the debris field might be. If  the re-entry point was at the time that JSPOC has its best guess of 04:16 GMT then all that debris wound up in the Pacific Ocean,\" Nick Johnson reiterated. UARS was deployed in 1991 from the space shuttle Discovery on a mission to study the Earth's upper atmosphere. It contributed important new understanding on subjects such as the chemistry of the protective ozone layer and the cooling effect volcanoes can exert on the global climate. In the past few days, Nasa had warned members of the public not to touch any pieces of the spacecraft that might survive the fall to land, urging them to contact local law enforcement authorities instead. \"I've seen some things that have re-entered and they tend to have sharp edges, so there's a little concern that they might hurt themselves if they try to pick them up,\" said Mark Matney, an orbital debris scientist from Nasa's Johnson Space Center. Under the terms of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, the US government retains ownership of the debris and could, if it so wished, seek to take possession of any items found on the ground. With those ownership rights also comes absolute liability if a piece of UARS is found to have damage property or injured someone. \"There is something called international responsibility; they're internationally liable,\" explained Joanne Wheeler of law firm CMS Cameron McKenna, and an expert representative for the UK on the UN Subcommittee for the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. \"The Americans have to retain jurisdiction and control, and that pretty much can be interpreted as ownership. So they own it up there, they own it if it comes down to Earth and they're liable if it crashes into something.\" Tracking stations will typically witness the uncontrolled return of at least one piece of space debris every day; and on average, one intact defunct spacecraft or old rocket body will come back into the atmosphere every week. Something the size of UARS is seen perhaps once a year. Much larger objects such as space station cargo ships return from orbit several times a year, but they are equipped with thrusters capable of guiding their dive into a remote part of the Southern Ocean.

That came hot on the heels of the biggest political U-turn in democratic South Africa's political history when he agreed to pay back to the state some of the millions spent on upgrading his private home, Nkandla. Yet it was a tactic that failed to pay dividends as the opposition went ahead with their case at the Constitutional Court in the hope that its ruling may open the way for impeachment proceedings against him. And then there have been the other upsets in recent months. The finance ministers fiasco when he had three within two days, sending the markets into freefall and sparking the Zuma Must Fall demonstrations, which were rooted in the student protests that rocked the country last year. And he was roundly mocked and forced to issue an apology for declaring at a business meeting that Africa was the biggest continent - forgetting the huge land mass that is Asia. But Mr Zuma has always been able to laugh off the many controversies he has faced, including - before his election in 2009 - fighting off allegations of rape and corruption in relation to an arms deal. And he has always relied on the backing of the governing African National Congress (ANC) to survive his scrapes. So despite his recent political battering, Mr Zuma - an avid chess player - is unlikely to throw in the towel himself. But the ruling of the Constitutional Court, which could take several months, and the outcome of upcoming local elections may ultimately decide his fate. The president can only be removed by the ANC. The party has a parliamentary majority and so his own MPs would have to vote for him to be fired. The other scenario is that the party's national executive could demand he go - as they did to Thabo Mbeki in 2008. There is no provision in the constitution for a president to be removed from power by recall but Mr Mbeki was forced to resign. For the moment that is unlikely as senior leaders in the former liberation movement are currently at loggerheads with trade unions. \"Zuma will continue to take advantage of these divisions.

{"article": "But the Dahl effect runs deeper, inspiring the imaginations of children and adults, and prompting an array of films, stage shows, merchandise and chocolate bars. Mention Dahl and his characters dominate the discussion. Willy Wonka, the BFG, Matilda. But what of the man who concocted the literary worlds that provided so much pleasure to generations of children and their parents? As the world marks the centenary of his birth in 2016, there will be a considerable effort to promote Wales' role in nurturing Roald Dahl. While he was born in Cardiff, his Norwegian heritage and an adult life spent mostly in England meant Wales had not always made the most of its fundamental claim. \"I think he is probably quite under-leveraged in Cardiff as a cultural icon. It's a chance to re-claim him as one of our own\", said Graeme Farrow, the artistic director of Wales Millennium Centre, who has pushed for a big Welsh birthday celebration to mark Dahl's centenary. \"Roald Dahl is a son of Cardiff, and he's particularly associated with the Bay. His father worked in the Coal Exchange, the area outside our building is named Roald Dahl Plas and the Norwegian church is around the corner. \"So I just thought, how could we not celebrate the centenary of one of Cardiff's most famous sons?\" ROALD DAHL'S CARDIFF CONNECTION Like the Dylan Thomas centenary in 2014, the events marking 100 years since Roald Dahl's birth will span the arts, schools and tourist trails in Wales. But Dahl's birthday in September is when Cardiff plans to host the biggest celebration of his life and work, with an unprecedented performance on the city's streets and in its best-known buildings. City of the Unexpected is being staged by Wales Millennium Centre and National Theatre Wales and directed by Nigel Jamieson, an Australian theatre director with an international profile. His previous commissions include the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony and the celebrations that started Liverpool's year as European City of Culture. He is promising \"three amazing days\" when Cardiff becomes the centre of Roald Dahl's centenary celebrations. A cast of thousands of actors, singers, dancers and ordinary members of the public will be involved in an event inspired by Dahl's incredible imagination. \"There'll be lots of Dahl characters, but the rhythm of the city and the laws of physics will also give way to the laws of Dahl's imagination. It will become a city of the unexpected, and reality will be full of surprises\", Mr Jamieson said. The director does not want to reveal too much about what he has planned, but the characters and creations from Roald Dahl's books will play a central part. He is hoping to recruit \"enthusiasts\" from other walks of life to be part of the show, with \"a huge range of people's skills and fascinations\" on display. Classic car clubs, sports teams, and animal handlers are thought to be among his wish-list of participants. The planning is advanced, and Jamieson's experience of working with large groups of performers means he is fairly relaxed about bringing thousands of people together in Cardiff. \"People are wonderful to work with, the bigger the event and the occasion the more they rise up to the challenges of it\", he said. City of the Unexpected will happen over the weekend of 17-18 September. Wales Millennium Centre will host an exhibition, The Wondercrump World of Roald Dahl, in the second half of 2016 which will feature artefacts from Dahl's personal life. It is also working with the Aloud charity to stage Land of Song, which will see school children across Wales learn songs inspired by Roald Dahl ahead of a series of performances in Cardiff Bay in June 2016. Literature Wales, which promotes reading, is distributing money to organisations hoping to stage their own events. Its chief executive, Lleucu Siencyn, said she was looking for events that focus on the \"makers of mischief, masters of invention and champions of good\". \"The challenge is to bring Dahl back to Wales. He's one of ours but not many people realise that. So let's make sure we bring Dahl back to Wales and we make it a year to remember,\" she said.

{"article": "On a bad day, the security checks could add a good hour to a round trip between Belfast and Dublin. Some in the Remain camp argued that a vote to exit the European Union would see a return of permanent border checkpoints. Those in the Leave camp, including Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, insisted that was nonsense. EU Referendum results So what now? The honest answer is that nobody quite knows. Those who dismiss claims that a \"hard border\" could return point to what is called the Common Travel Area between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which allows the free movement of people and goods. There have been such agreements, which pre-dated the European Union (EU), that allowed easier cross-border movement. However, it is unclear how those arrangements will be affected by the UK's withdrawal from the EU. When the United Kingdom formally exits the EU, it is possible the EU will insist on some form of checks on the movement of people for security reasons, and goods, for the purposes of gathering any taxes due on products entering its territory from a non-member state. However, there would be enormous pressure on the Irish government to resist any EU demands for permanent border checkpoints for domestic political reasons. When he began talking to Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in in the hope of influencing republicans to end their campaign of violence, former SDLP leader John Hume argued that the border was irrelevant and did not exist in practical terms. The sight of armed guards at permanent border checkpoints would make that border highly visible and hugely controversial. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny said on Friday that the Irish government will seek to maintain the Common Travel Area. That clearly suggests he does not envisage a \"hard border\". It is unclear at this stage what impact Brexit might have on policing arrangements in Northern Ireland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) can currently share intelligence with other European police forces and access central data bases through Europol, and can participate in joint investigation teams. It can also use European Arrest Warrants to ask other police forces to arrest suspects on its behalf. Likewise, other European police forces regularly ask the PSNI to act on their behalf. The future of all of those arrangements and structures is now unclear. It is possible they may all have to re-negotiated by the British government with each individual member state in the EU. The PSNI hopes that will not be necessary and that the EU will recognise the mutual benefits of keeping existing arrangements in place.

{"article": "Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said that Senior Deputy Ben Fields \"did not follow proper procedure\". He was a school resource officer at the school in South Carolina. He \"should not have thrown a student - he could have done a lot of things he was trained to do, he was not trained to throw a student\", Sheriff Lott said. The incident occurred at the Spring Valley High School in Columbia, witnesses said, when the unnamed African-American student refused to put away her mobile phone and then refused to leave the classroom. The officer was then summoned and asked her to leave again. She refused, and he told her she was under arrest. Video then shows the officer violently knocking the student down and pulling her across the floor. The incident was filmed by a fellow student and was published on the internet, prompting the hashtag #AssaultAtSpringValleyHigh to circulate on Twitter and an outcry from various civil rights and parents' groups. Mr Lott said he had received expressions of support for the officer, who had been at the school seven years, from some parents and school officials. Officer Fields had received a \"Culture of Excellence\" award last year by an elementary school where he was also assigned. But Sheriff Lott said the officer had \"lost control\" and had not dealt with this incident correctly. \"That is not a proper technique and should not be used in law enforcement. And based on that, that is a violation of our policy and approximately 20 minutes ago Officer Ben Fields was terminated from the Richland County Sheriff's Department.\" He said complaints had been made about Officer Fields during his time at the school - some had been upheld and some had not. Legal action has been taken three times against the officer, according to Associated Press news agency: The deputy has not been criminally charged but the Federal Bureau of Investigation and justice department have opened a civil rights investigation into the arrest. Fellow students at the school have tweeted claims that they have seen him behaving in a similar manner in the past, but this was the first time such an incident was caught on camera. Sheriff Lott has said the girl was unhurt in the incident aside from a carpet burn. However, the girl's attorney, Todd Rutherford, told ABC's Good Morning America' that she \"has a cast on her arm, she has neck and back injuries\" as well as a plaster on her forehead because of the carpet burn.

{"article": "Staff and volunteers at Felbrigg Hall, a stately home in Norfolk, were asked to wear badges and lanyards in support of an LGBTQ campaign. But 30 of the 350 volunteers were offered duties away from the public after choosing not to wear them. In a statement, the trust said it would now be an \"optional\" decision. A spokesman also confirmed all volunteers could resume their public-facing roles and it was \"business as usual\". The row was sparked following the National Trust's Prejudice and Pride campaign to mark the 50th anniversary of homosexuality being decriminalised. As part of the campaign the conservation charity is holding an exhibition at the estate, including a film, which reveals Felbrigg's last lord, Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer, was gay, which was known by close friends. However, in an article in the Telegraph last week, the lord's godchildren criticised the move, saying it was unfair of the organisation to \"out\" someone who chose to keep his sexuality secret. Several volunteers on the estate were reported to have agreed with them. The National Trust had initially said it was committed to promoting equality and inclusion and in a letter to Saturday's Telegraph its director general Dame Helen Ghosh said anyone who did not agree with the campaign was \"free to step back from the volunteer role or take a different role for the duration\". However, the organisation later released a statement saying it was now \"making it clear to volunteers that the wearing of the badge is optional and a personal decision\". The statement added: \"We are aware some volunteers had conflicting, personal opinions about wearing the rainbow lanyards and badges. \"That was never our intention.\" Dame Helen said the National Trust was marking the anniversary of the law change at \"a dozen or so of our properties of the people who lived there and whose personal lives were outside the social norms of their time\".

{"article": "TUV Rheinland, which awarded EU safety certificates to the French implant manufacturer, \"neglected its duties of vigilance\", the court said. PIP (Poly Implant Prothese) was shut down in March 2010 amidst a worldwide health scare. The company used sub-standard silicone gel, causing many implants to rupture. Q&A: Breast implants health scare Six implant distributors and 1,700 women had sued TUV Rheinland for 50m euros (\u00c2\u00a342m), arguing anything but a cursory inspection would have found problems. The plaintiffs in the civil case will be given an initial payment of 3,000 euros per victim for surgery to have the implants removed. Jan Spivey, a British woman who received PIP implants as part of reconstructive surgery following breast cancer in 2002, said she was \"delighted\" with the ruling. \"Of course TUV has some responsibility and should be held to account. They're the organisation that gives the CE certification for safety, and that was what my surgeon relied on when he gave the implants to me. \"Anybody that gives safety certification for a product that is going to make women very sick does have responsibility,\" she told the BBC's Newshour programme. It could open the door to many more compensation claims, says the BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris. TUV Rheinland had won two previous cases in Germany. This was the first such case in France. The German firm has said it will appeal against the verdict. TUV Rheinland awarded PIP - formerly one of the world's leading suppliers of implants - its European safety certificate for 17 years. The founder of PIP, Jean Claude Mas, is still on trial for aggravated fraud in Marseilles, along with four of his executives. He revealed during police interviews that he had ordered employees to hide the unauthorised silicone when inspectors visited his factory. It has since emerged the substandard gel was used in 75% of the implants.

{"article": "Both clubs had an easy \u00a350m or so to spend on central strikers, and the best they could apparently come up with between them was a kid with a handful of goals to his name so far. While Martial has been a revelation for United, a turbo-charged and cool-headed game-changer in terms of his impact on the team so far, Arsene Wenger was left examining internal solutions. For Arsenal, who spent most of the transfer window like a teenager agonisingly watching the telephone to see if Karim Benzema's number would flash up, this was particularly frustrating. Ever since the most prolific striker in their history, Thierry Henry, opined last April that Arsenal couldn't win the Premier League title without an upgrade in that department, the pressure to improve cranked up. \"I'm afraid they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again,\" he said. It was pretty clear, as far as Henry was concerned, that his compatriot Olivier Giroud was not in that \"top, top quality\" bracket. It is telling that Theo Walcott was not really a major part of that conversation. At the time he was kicking his heels, mostly on the bench, trying to maintain the right mixture of patience and determination to take a chance when it came having spent a year recovering from a cruciate ligament injury. More or less all of 2014 was spent rehabilitating, and changing his perspective as he became a father. Arsenal's first choice centre-forward? It was his ambition but it felt like a long shot. Right now, ahead of a compelling challenge between Arsenal and Manchester United this weekend at the Emirates, the position feels like Walcott's for the taking. He has had to wait a long time to press his case. As he says: \"I'll play anywhere, but the manager started playing me up front slowly.\" Opportunities are now knocking. Wenger's inability to sign anyone in the last transfer window pushed Walcott up the pecking order, which appears to have been advanced even more by Giroud having a difficult time of it lately. The Frenchman was jeered when he missed some chances for the national team, and sent off in Arsenal's defeat by Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League, and Walcott looks to have eased in front. Giroud was the starter for the first two games of the Premier League campaign. But since then Walcott has started five of the last six Premier League and Champions League fixtures. Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright recently called for Walcott to be given \"a genuine run of games up there\u2026 let him prove he can do it\". He has responded by chipping in with regular goals and assists. His chance conversion still needs to improve, but 12 from 13 Premier League starts is not to be sniffed at. Once he got that unexpected berth to lead the line at the FA Cup final, in which he opened the scoring against Aston Villa, this was always going to be a key season. His confident body language suggests he feels he belongs up front now and welcomes the responsibility. He also possesses a coolness of character which means he doesn't look affected if he misses a chance, and just concentrates on waiting for the next one. Can he be the answer? It is still too early to say, but one thing that is clearly different about this campaign is Wenger's attitude towards a player he has worked on for almost a decade. For the first time the manager regards Walcott purely as a central striker. Every minute of this season he has played so far has been in that role, not at all on the right flank he occupied for a long time, where he could sometimes get lost. His performance against Leicester last weekend was full of the kind of movement to stretch defences, sharp runs, and strong interplay with team-mates that outline his case well. The unconvinced point out that Leicester, with their high defensive line and cavalier style, are dream opponents for a speedy player like Walcott to whizz around on the counter-attack. The question of whether he can be as effective in tight home games where buses are parked and spaces squeezed remains in the balance. If during that sequence of games Wright called for, he can learn to be effective, and make the difference, in those situations Arsenal really might be on to something. Walcott mentioned Wright's style as an inspiration. \"He obviously scored so many goals and caused havoc for defenders. He wasn't the tallest man in the world but the amount of pressure he would put on defenders just scared them,\" Walcott explained in an interview with Arsenal Player. \"I can learn from the runs he made, the pace he had in his game and his finishing. When he was in the box he didn't panic.\" A connection with Alexis Sanchez is forming. As well as enjoying the space to dash into at Leicester, they created a goal for each other in the Champions League defeat by Olympiakos. It was a bright spot on a dark night for Arsenal, and a positive for Wenger to cling to as they prepare for United's visit. It seems extraordinary that the England forward will have been at Arsenal long enough to qualify for a testimonial soon. In January he will have been at the club for 10 years. The manager sees a difference in the 26-year-old these days, and the influence he hopes he can bring. \"When he arrived here he was a boy, a little boy who discovered a world where he did not know anything about it. He has become very mature, he has gone through difficult periods so he is a very strong man today. He can become a prolific goalscorer.\" Henry, who spends so much time around Arsenal these days as he works on his coaching badges, will cast his eye over both Walcott and Martial with considerable interest this weekend.", "question": "On the day Anthony Martial 's status exploded as the teenager became a luxury - @placeholder prospect for Manchester United , and Arsenal 's vain summer search for an elite striker ended in disappointment , it was easy to reach the conclusion that the pool of established , talented forwards at the north London club was worryingly dry .", "option_0": "warming", "option_1": "star", "option_2": "priced", "option_3": "editing", "option_4": "buying", "label": 2}
{"article": "The recent release of thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables is just the latest in a long list of \"leaks\" published by the secretive site, which has established a reputation for publishing sensitive material from governments and other high-profile organisations. In October the site released almost 400,000 secret US military logs detailing its operations in Iraq. They followed hot on the heels of nearly 90,000 classified military records, which gave an insight into the military strategy in Afghanistan. And in April 2010, for example, Wikileaks posted a video on its website that shows a US Apache helicopter killing at least 12 people - including two Reuters journalists - during an attack in Baghdad in 2007. A US military analyst is currently awaiting trial, on charges of leaking the material along with the cables and military documents. However, the site's recent prominence is part of a longer and controversial history that started in December 2006, when it first hit the net. Since that time it has split opinion. Spotlight on 'sensitive' sites For some it is lauded as the future of investigative journalism; it has been described as the world's first stateless news organisation. For others - particularly the governments and corporations whose secrets it exposes - it is a risk. In October 2009, it posted a list of names and addresses of people it claimed belonged to the British National Party (BNP). The BNP said the list was a \"malicious forgery\". And during the 2008 US elections, it published screenshots of the e-mail inbox, pictures and address book of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Other controversial documents hosted on the site include a copy of the Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta, a document that detailed restrictions placed on prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Many of these were uploaded to the website, which allows anyone to submit documents anonymously. However, a team of reviewers - volunteers from the mainstream press, journalists and Wikileaks staff - decides what is published. \"We use advanced cryptographic techniques and legal techniques to protect sources,\" Mr Assange told the BBC in February. The site says that it accepts \"classified, censored or otherwise restricted material of political, diplomatic or ethical significance\" but does not take \"rumour, opinion or other kinds of first hand reporting or material that is already publicly available\". \"We specialise in allowing whistle-blowers and journalists who have been censored to get material out to the public,\" said Mr Assange. It is operated by an organisation known as the Sunshine Press and claims to be \"funded by human rights campaigners, investigative journalists, technologists and the general public\". Since Wikileaks first appeared on the net, it has faced various legal challenges to take it offline. Prior to the most recent leaks, it said it had fought off more than 100 legal challenges successfully. In 2008, for example, the Swiss bank Julius Baer won a court ruling to block the site after Wikileaks posted \"several hundred\" documents about its offshore activities. It was eventually overturned. But more recently, the site has faced new challenges. The private life of Mr Assange, its editor-in-chief, has been laid bare and it has lost key staff and supporters. The site has also been targeted in a series of cyber attacks. Various firms - including web giant Amazon - have also terminated agreements to host the site and provide services to it. In addition, companies - including Mastercard, Visa and PayPal -  have withdrawn the ability that allows people to donate to the site. Its Swiss bank account has also been closed. But it is not the first time that the site has faced financial problems. In February 2010 it suspended operations as it could not afford its own running costs. Donations from individuals and organisations saved the site. Only time will tell, if it can do it again with many sources of funding now cut off. Despite all of these setbacks, Wikileaks has largely remained defiantly online. It has moved its operations between various companies and countries. It has also encouraged volunteers to set up \"mirrors\" of the site - hosted on different servers around the world. \"[To] keep our sources safe, we have had to spread assets, encrypt everything, and move telecommunications and people around the world to activate protective laws in different national jurisdictions,\" Mr Assange said earlier this year. Throughout its history, the site has been supported and hosted by the Swedish ISP PeRiQuito (PRQ), which became famous for hosting file-sharing website The Pirate Bay. \"If it is legal in Sweden, we will host it, and will keep it up regardless of any pressure to take it down,\" the ISP's site says. The ISP continues to host its most recent - and most controversial - documents. The site also hosts documents in other jurisdictions, including France. Its experience of different laws around the world meant that it was drafted to help Icelandic MPs draw up plans for its Icelandic Modern Media Initiative (IMMI) earlier this year The plan calls on the country's government to adopt laws protecting journalists and their sources. Its involvement in the IMMI gave the site a new credibility. At the same time, it has grown and gained more notoriety. The site's rapid expansion - and the amount of material it has recently received - has meant that it has had to change its tactics. In the past, it was able to verify and publish documents itself. But for its most recent leaks it has adopted a new tactic - partnering with news organisations such as the Guardian, Der Spiegel and the New York Times - to help check and distribute the material. \"We take care of the source and act as a neutral intermediary and then we also take care of the publication of the material whilst the journalist that has been communicated with takes care of the verification,\" Mr Assange said earlier this year. \"It provides a natural\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 connection between a journalist and a source with us in the middle performing the function that we perform best.\"", "question": "Whistle - blowing website Wikileaks has @placeholder the news , both because of its steady drip feed of secret documents , but also because of the dealings of its enigmatic front man Julian Assange .", "option_0": "opened", "option_1": "captured", "option_2": "dominated", "option_3": "entered", "option_4": "delivered", "label": 2}

{"article": "Similar to the December plans which were suspended, there will be three sets of dates for industrial action by junior doctors in England. Two of them will see routine and non-urgent care affected by doctors' walkouts. The third, in February, will involve doctors refusing to provide any care, including for emergencies. So what chance is there, if any, of the first strike on January 12th being avoided? Both sides have said they are willing to go to the conciliation service ACAS but getting the process set up and running in time for enough ground to be covered seems a big ask. Jeremy Hunt has introduced a new senior player into his negotiating team - Sir David Dalton, chief executive of Salford Royal Foundation Trust - in Mr Hunt's words to \"facilitate further constructive discussion\". The Secretary of State no doubt hopes a fresh perspective from an experienced NHS chief might help break the logjam. But the words from both sides after the announcement of strikes by the British Medical Association did not suggest there was a lot of room for manoeuvre.  Interpretations of what happened on Monday, the first day of substantive talks since before Christmas, differed significantly. Frustration and diminishing trust were all too apparent. The Government side, comprising the Department of Health and NHS Employers, said they were bemused at the turn of events. They say they went into Monday's meeting with a significant new proposal aimed at addressing the BMA's concern about doctors being made to work excessive hours. This would see trusts fined for breaches of agreed ceilings on hours in a system overseen by \"Guardians\" responsible for safeguarding doctors' working conditions. The Government side claim that the BMA read through the proposal but refused to discuss it before announcing their strike plans. Mr Hunt argues that 15 out of 16 key issues in the dispute have been addressed by the Government and that its only pay for unsocial hours which is unresolved. He appears to have reached this figure by taking the areas identified at earlier ACAS talks and added some issues of concern raised by the BMA. The BMA has rejected the idea there is only one out of 16 issues which is still outstanding. Ministers may feel they have addressed important areas of dispute but, doctors argue, that's not the same as resolving them. The union is adamant that the stumbling block is not just pay and that there are major differences over safeguards on hours. BMA leaders say the new plans for fining trusts put forward by the employers did not add up and were far from robust, so were not worth discussing. The clock is ticking and the first day of action is not far off. The BMA, while being ready for further talks, seems determined to press on with action if required with all the implications for patients.

Instead, she intends to focus upon securing the best possible deal from Brexit for Scotland. She believes, further, that such a mission is made more feasible by a UK Government weakened by the absence of a single party majority. So what has changed, in practice, as opposed to rhetorically? Not, you understand, that the UK Government and the Conservative Party regarded the demand as urgent in the first place. The Scottish Secretary David Mundell has said not now, almost certainly not within the lifetime of the present Holyrood Parliament. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, has come within a whisker of saying \"not ever\" - although, to be clear, she retains the option of indyref2 returning at some point. So, one, the indyref2 Bill is shelved. Two, the Section 30 request is also on ice. But, three, the First Minister intends to return to the topic once Brexit negotiations conclude which she anticipates should be in Autumn 2018. Certainly not a surrender, then. Not a retreat. Perhaps a tactical withdrawal, recognising that the talk of indyref2 damaged the SNP during the UK election in which the party lost 21 seats - while still outpolling all their opponents in Scotland. To be clear, further, Ms Sturgeon believes it is still in prospect that there will be an independence referendum before the next Holyrood elections in May 2021. I asked her about this. She began her reply by using the word \"likely\" in re indyref2. Somewhat cheekily, I intervened to offer the alternative phrase \"highly likely\" - the verdict she had herself used on the morning after the Brexit vote. Rightly ignoring my insolence, Ms Sturgeon continued to explain that it would still be feasible to restart the process after Brexit talks concluded - and to hold such a poll before that next Holyrood contest. Which prompts a range of questions. One, would there be time? The Scottish Government believes that the ground work - now shelved - is there. The Holyrood Bill is ready, albeit now in abeyance. The issues arising from a Section 30 transfer were well ventilated last time out, before the 2014 poll. Two, will Nicola Sturgeon go for it? She is resolutely not saying, as a matter of policy. She believes folk are, as outlined earlier, fed up with endless talk of the referendum process. So no more on that for now. Instead, she will re-energise the campaign on the broader concept of independence itself, rather than the process. Linking that, at all times, to the challenge she sees posed by Brexit. Three, would the UK Government tolerate indyref2 on that amended timetable? There are very few signs that they would - although, of course, Brexit could change matters. At Holyrood, opposition leaders who support the Union accused Ms Sturgeon of being in denial. They said there should be no indyref2 during the present Holyrood Parliament. And David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, amplified that point on behalf of the UK Government who, remember, would have to sanction indyref2 on the basis that Holyrood does not presently have the power. He says the FM has merely sanctioned a postponement, rather than taking the issue off the table which, he asserts, is what the people want. Little sign there of bending to the FM's possible future will. An issue deferred, then. But an issue which remains the fundamental fault line in Scottish politics.", "question": "I have always felt the \" scunner factor \" to be particularly potent in contemporary politics .

The safety and management of the Brighton hospital's A&E unit were rated \"inadequate\" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) on Friday. Chief nurse Sherree Fagge said the changes would be dramatic. \"The first new building will open in late 2019,\" she said. \"On that day I think few people will recognise it as the same hospital they have visited in the past.\" The government approved the full business case for the redevelopment last week. The full rebuilding programme will take nine years and be split into three stages but all clinical services will remain on site throughout. Ms Fagge said all the buildings along the front of the hospital would be replaced, including some in use 25 years before Florence Nightingale began nursing in the 1840s. Brighton's A&E unit was rated the second worst in England in July, with 19.9% of people waiting more than four hours. Richard Beard, spokesman for Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, said the redevelopment would ease pressure on A&E.

{"article": "\"That should be something which is enabled and encouraged, not slowed down by BT,\" he told the House of Commons on Tuesday evening. The MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich had called a debate about the roll out of superfast broadband which he called: \"The single most important issue facing rural Suffolk and many rural businesses and homes.\" Many schools and farmers in his constituency were served by poor broadband provision, he told MPs. Some places had been waiting for more than two years for superfast broadband, while those who had it found that it didn't live up to its name. Suffolk and Norfolk were two of the first counties in the country to sign up to the superfast broadband roll out: a deal between the government, county councils and BT to provide better broadband to homes and villages in rural areas. Dr Poulter conceded that the scheme is going well with 100,000 new properties due to be upgraded by this September, but his concern was that BT was dragging its feet and was slow to prioritise coverage in hard to reach areas. \"Suffolk has had issues with getting BT to prioritise coverage of industrial estates and business parks which are vital to the Suffolk economy,\" he said. \"In general BT tend to ignore Suffolk's priorities in favour of their own.\" Other MPs from Suffolk agreed. Peter Aldous (Waveney) claimed BT had under invested in its commercial roll-out. His colleague Jo Churchill (Bury St Edmunds) called superfast connectivity \"the fourth utility\". He said: \"It disables our constituents if we do not give them the facility.\" Dr Poulter had another gripe which many broadband users may also share - \"superfast broadband is only superfast at times of low usage,\" he said. \"Businesses will obviously be using the internet and broadband services at peak times and if the superfast broadband service they have bought into is not superfast, then it is not fit for the purpose for which it was intended.\" This is not the first time that MPs from the East have expressed concern about the speed of the broadband roll out and the role of BT. Several from the region were present at another Westminster debate a few weeks ago on the provision of broadband in the South West. South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon expressed his frustration with BT by accusing the company of \"talking crap\". The Culture Minister Ed Vaizey told this week's debate he was unstinting in his praise for BT but believed \"it does have some problems with customer service\". He added that it was slow to keep its promises and explain to customers why delays occur. \"When BT gets on the ground and does the mapping exercises, it might find that getting to a particular village is more complicated than it had thought, so it revises its plan,\" he said. This, he accepted, caused \"great consternation\" and he said BT should be better at keeping customers informed. Although he added that people should remember: \"We cannot deliver it overnight.\" A spokesman for BT told us:\" We are committed to making superfast fibre broadband as widely available across Suffolk as quickly as possible. \"It's a huge task with around 100 engineers and support staff involved, and we have already connected 367 green roadside fibre broadband cabinets and laid more than 1,700km of fibre cable\".", "question": "Was Dr Dan Poulter MP speaking for many businesses and households in the region when he called on BT to \" go further and faster and more quickly \" when there is @placeholder ?", "option_0": "helping", "option_1": "capacity", "option_2": "growing", "option_3": "no", "option_4": "one", "label": 1}

Mr Grimstone, 23, worked at the club for the past seven years - starting with the Albion as part of the match day event team at Withdean. Chief executive Paul Barber said: \"Matt's been a very popular member of our ground staff team and has proved to be an absolute credit to the club and his boss Steve Winterburn.\" Worthing United FC released a statement, saying:  \"Grimbles was our first team goalkeeper, 23 years of age and a huge talent, quiet and reserved but a brilliant player with a huge potential to go further in the game.\" Jacob Schilt Seagulls supporter Mr Schilt was travelling with his Mavericks teammate Matthew Grimstone when their vehicle was hit by the aircraft.

She said she received several hundreds of messages, including death threats, adding: \"It was absolutely vitriolic\". It came after the High Court ruled that Theresa May must seek Parliamentary approval before invoking Article 50 to start formal EU exit negotiations. London's Gina Miller, an investment manager and philanthropist, was the lead claimant in the case and was widely photographed and quoted in media coverage of the decision. Brexit court case: Who is Gina Miller? The US-based Ms Miller said she first became aware of the London investment manager's legal moves in October, after a few people mixed up the two women's Twitter addresses. But she said Thursday's \"crazy\" Brexit backlash took her completely by surprise. \"On Twitter, on Facebook - there were some f-bombs, lots of people saying I was a traitor. 'You're ruining our democracy', 'F-off and move to France' - and much more'. She added: \"I even had an email. In the subject box it said: 'I hope you die, I sincerely hope you get cancer and die'.\" Having visited the UK on previous occasions, Ms Miller said: \"It was in overwhelming contrast to the very proper, polite British behaviour I'd seen before.\" The London-based Ms Miller, 51, who was born in Guyana but grew up in Britain, has not answered those critics who have targeted her on social media. But speaking outside the High Court on Thursday, she said she was aware of being called a \"black widow spider\" and had suffered abuse from those in favour of leaving the EU. She said: \"That nickname is wrong on so many levels. But I do not and will not let other people bring me down. I believe that level of abuse means I am doing something right for investors.\" She did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. The American Gina Miller, who is also a multi-media consultant with Smith Geiger, a market research and strategy group, said: \"If I were counselling her, I'd suggest she be a little bit more overt [on social media]. \"You have to expect some sort of reaction - and it's better to take ownership of it.\" One of the legal groups that brought the case to the High Court, Mishcon de Reya, previously said that a number of other clients who wanted to join the action withdrew their names after receiving letters of abuse. Yet for US-based Ms Miller, the abuse has introduced her to a whole new fanbase - boosting her number of followers on Twitter to 28,000 - who can now keep up with her daily insights on American football and baseball.

{"article": "Hafez al-Assad was the architect of modern Syria. Following decades of coups and counter-coups in Syria, Hafez used the network he had built in the posts of Commander of the Syrian air force and Minister of Defence to seize power in 1970. To maintain his position, Hafez created a system of divide and rule and personalised his power to such an extent that it was he alone who held the state together. His successor would inherit a weak government and state institutions. It was Hafez's eldest son, Bassel, that was groomed for power. But Bassel's death in a car accident in 1994 thrust his brother Bashar to the fore. When Bashar al-Assad assumed the presidency in 2000 following Hafez's death, many expected him to be a chip off the old block, but this has not proved to be the case. When Bashar took over, he was obliged at first to work with his father's coterie of revolutionary leaders - many of whom had headed the state's key institutions, such as the security services and military, for decades. But, in order to assert his independence, he slowly pushed them aside in favour of his own close set of advisers. In most cases, key ministries and state agencies had been under the purview of Hafez's trusted allies since the 1970s. Although these institutions were politically weak, they had served as important vehicles of patronage and provided an essential link between the presidency and its support base. As such, state institutions engendered a strong sense of loyalty among their employees and beneficiaries and, in doing so, became sturdy pillars of the state. By pushing his father's peers aside, Bashar imposed his own urban elite on society and undermined the integrity of key institutions. Hafez rose to power with a generation of leaders that had emerged largely from rural provinces and retained close links to their constituencies. Bashar's inner circle, on the other hand, essentially comprises children of the elite - a generation raised in the city, with no constituency other than their own concentric networks of influence. The extent of Bashar's control was the subject of much debate right up to the beginning of the uprisings in March 2011. There were questions over whether Bashar was subject to the undue influence of powerful \"barons\" and family members, including his sister, Bushra, her late husband, Asef Shawkat, and his brother Maher. Many concluded that Bashar was a natural reformer and had every intention of opening Syria up, but was constrained by his father's clique. This was a simplistic assessment of Bashar's character; Bashar carefully cultivated a number of Western journalists, academics and policy-makers to help him appear accessible, sympathetic and thoughtful.

{"article": "Leading 2-1 from the first leg, the visitors extended their advantage through Ibrahimovic's scruffy first-time shot from Kim Kallstrom's corner. Ibrahimovic clipped in a 25-yard free-kick to all but clinch a finals spot. Denmark levelled on the night through Yussuf Poulsen and Jannik Vestergaard, but fell two goals short on aggregate. Following Ibrahimovic's two away goals, the 1992 European champions needed to score at least four times in Copenhagen to avoid being eliminated after scoring just once themselves in Sweden. Despite their late rally, it proved a task too far for the Danes as veteran coach Morten Olsen's 15-year reign came to an end. Olsen's side dominated the opening exchanges, but were left deflated when Ibrahimovic peeled off his marker to convert Kallstrom's well-worked corner.

{"article": "In late 1944, Major Hunter Reinburg, commanding officer of 122 Squadron of the American Marine Corps, had a hankering for ice cream. Not surprising perhaps, since he was posted to the sweltering, jungle-covered South Pacific island of Peleliu. So Hunter set his resourceful team of aircraft engineers to work on Operation Freeze. After some trial and error, they found that by mounting a large can filled with milk onto the underside of each wing tip of their fighter planes, attaching a stirring shaft to a wind-driven propeller, and then undertaking a training sortie at 30,000 feet, they could supply 100 servicemen with a helping of ice cream every day, whilst simultaneously provoking the Japanese to waste a few shells trying to bring them down. Hunter was, however, missing a trick. If, instead of flavouring his favourite treat with army-issue cocoa powder, he'd cast his eye around him to see what fruits and spices the South Pacific had to offer, then he really would have been ahead of his time. He could have tried lychee, coconut, cardamom, nutmeg or ginger - flavours that ice cream makers are now starting to experiment with. In the 70 years since Hunter went to such lengths to satisfy his passion for frozen dairy desserts, global ice cream brands have spread their reach to almost every corner of the planet. Even in Peleliu he could now probably pick up a Cornetto from his corner store. But for many years, flavours from the big international brands remained stubbornly conservative,  dominated by chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. Now though, thanks to migration, long-haul travel, and the internet, consumers are becoming more adventurous and manufacturers are taking note. Parlours have sprung up across the US offering Persian-style saffron, orange blossom, and rosewater ice cream, sprinkled with nuts and drizzled with honey; and Indian-inspired flavours such as masala chai, pineapple, and kulfi. At Chinatown Ice Cream Factory in New York, where they've been offering exotic ice creams for 40 years, they've noticed an uptick in interest from customers. Owner Christina Seid says there's often a queue of 20 customers waiting to try her Chinese-inspired range, which includes red bean, toasted sesame, and taro (a kind of sweet potato) ice cream. She thinks Americans are ready to embrace these flavours in a way they perhaps weren't when her parents, Chinese immigrants, first set up the shop. \"My father was the pioneer of a lot of these flavours. Back then people didn't even know what a mango or green tea was. \"Now, nothing is really weird.\" She thinks red bean flavour, common in China, will eventually become mainstream in the US. 13bn litres eaten globally last year China consumed most at 3.3bn litres Norwegians ate the most per head at 9.8 litres Sales grew fastest in India at 13% In many of the world's biggest ice cream markets appetites have been flagging for traditional take-home tubs. Consumers are worrying about the sugar content and there's a lot of competition. According to market research firm Mintel, ice cream sales are stalling in some markets. As a result, firms are watching what happens in places like The Chinatown Ice Cream Factory carefully. \"Trends are born in the parlours where they can afford to take a gamble,\" says Alex Beckett, global food and drink analyst at Mintel. \"They become fashionable. Then they travel from Brooklyn to LA and Chicago, then to Sydney, London, Berlin, and eventually they will be picked up by manufacturers who will start to set the market for these more ethnic styles\" Yee Kwan Chan, who is based in the UK city of Sheffield and whose family is also Chinese, travels to far flung parts of the world in search of inspiration for her Yee Kwan line of desserts. \"I just want to create authentic flavours you'd find in Asia,\" she says. Her concoctions include chocolate miso, black sesame seed, and durian - the fruit with the pungent odour often likened to sewage or something rotting - which is surprisingly popular in Asia. At Christmas she travelled to Hong Kong and is now producing egg custard tart ice cream, evoking the afternoon tea treat popular there. \"With the East Asian palate we've got sweet and we've got sour and then we have bitter: we use all our senses,\" says Ms Chan. With foreign travel and Asian food so popular, she's convinced that Asian-inspired flavours will be on the shop shelves in the US and Europe as a matter of course in a few years' time. But for that to happen at any scale, larger manufacturers will also need to get on board. Unilever, the world's largest producer, is open to the idea. They already make a myriad of flavours to suit local palates, including red bean Cornettos in China, a liquorice recipe for Scandinavia, and they've just launched a \"dung dung\" ice cream - based on an \"earthy\" tasting fruit - in Indonesia. Matt Close, Unilever's executive vice president of global ice cream, says they've always got an eye out for new flavours that might \"travel\".

This year in India, the world's fastest growing ice cream market, they launched a kulfi ice cream, made with condensed milk and flavoured with rose water so it tastes a little like Turkish Delight. \"I'm absolutely convinced kulfi would work in the UK,\" says Mr Close. \"You'd start where there are big Indian communities, but there is no reason that wouldn't stretch.\" While taro and red bean recipes might be harder to export, matcha (green tea) flavours seem likely to be at the forefront of any Asian invasion, he thinks. \"We've just launched a matcha ice cream in the Philippines. We'll take it to other markets. \"I'd put money on the idea that there'd be green tea ice cream or green tea ice lollies in most markets in the not too distant future.\" Booza - also known as Dondurma (in Turkey), this is made with ground powdered orchid root and mastic gum.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Never is it easy. Seldom is it predictable. Only occasionally does it not involve knocking knees and mangled nerves. The Grand Slam dream is on for England, but this was so nearly a nightmare to out-do even the horrors of the World Cup defeat seven months ago. England were 16-0 ahead at half-time, a lead that should have been at least seven points wider. With seven minutes to go that had shifted out to 25-7. Game over. Set sights on Paris, start thinking about only a second Slam in 20 years. Maybe that was the problem. That, a couple of missed tackles, and Rhys Priestland suddenly moving the ball like Rhys Priestland can sometimes, and George North racing away for one try, and then Toby Faletau crashing through for another. Four minutes, 14 points. Twickenham gone from party to panic, England defending with 14 men, North set free again to accelerate at the left-hand corner flag. In that World Cup match England had blown a 10-point lead with just over half an hour to play, thrown away a seven-point advantage with 10 minutes left. In 2008, at the start of Wales' own Grand Slam year, they had led 16-6 at the interval and shipped 20 points after it. This would have been more calamitous still. Had Manu Tuilagi not reached North and shoved him into touch, it might have come to pass. Had the line judge the advantage of the many screen-grabs doing the social media rounds late on Saturday night, he might not have called North out at all. Tuilagi had been predicted to make a critical impact off the bench. What no-one foresaw was that it would be with a tackle rather than a run. It should never have got so close, for this was a match not only being dominated by England at the interval but being butchered by Wales. Wales coach Warren Gatland was full of furrowed-brow fury afterwards. \"Only the players can answer the question why they were so flat and lethargic, because we didn't turn up in that first half. At this level it's not acceptable as far as I'm concerned.\" You could understand the anger even if you took umbrage at the abdication of responsibility, or neglected to recall that the same thing happened in their opening fixture against Ireland. In Dublin, Wales had fallen 13 points down before rousing themselves and fighting back for a draw that could have been more. At Twickenham they were not just off the pace but off the scale. Nineteen missed tackles in the first 40 minutes alone, eight penalties conceded, line-outs lost, hard hands and soft heads everywhere. Alex Cuthbert had one of those games when he looks less like a lethal finisher and more like a man likely only to shoot himself in the foot. The only complaint about England was one that dogged them under previous coach Stuart Lancaster: a profligacy in attack, a lack of ruthlessness with the line in sight and the defence splintered. Media playback is not supported on this device Twice in the first 20 minutes they blew clear try-scoring chances, once when Mike Brown cut back inside rather than pinning back ears for the empty corner, again when George Ford failed to spot Anthony Watson overlapping and unmarked outside him and held on instead. Ford endured one of his more difficult games, his charged-down kick leading to the Dan Biggar try that first gave Wales hope, even if Ben Youngs' long, underpowered pass also played its part. There was so much else that was good about England that it didn't seem to matter. Quick ball from the forwards put Youngs on his toes and the men outside him in space. Smart use of that ball stretched the usually tight Welsh defence one way and then back the other. Leading the charge was Maro Itoje, described by Jones as a Vauxhall Viva at the start of this campaign, upgraded to an Astra after his first start a fortnight go, on Saturday crashing through tackles like a bulldozer, digging at the breakdown like a JCB and accelerating away from defenders like a Porsche. For a 21-year-old in his first season of international rugby it was dangerously close to the complete second-row performance: 14 tackles, more than any other England player, two defenders beaten, one clean break made, a turnover won, two Welsh line-outs stolen and all four thrown to him secured. It is just one reason why England supporters will go into next Saturday's Grand Slam decider against France with significantly more optimism than the last two times a clean sweep was in sight. They are away once again, just as they were against Wales on the final night of the 2013 season and against Ireland on the last afternoon in 2011. But while Wales were a team with two Slams of their own in the previous four seasons and a side about to supply the key men in a Lions series victory, and Ireland a team containing two of the all-time greats in Brian O'Driscoll and Paul O'Connell, this is a French side as predictable as those of old were cavalier. Not since 2011 have they finished above fourth in the Six Nations table. Only once in the past five meetings between these two in this tournament have they emerged victorious, and that with a last-gasp try two years ago. Springtime in Paris has always held its own special allure. Next Saturday it could be where an English nation falls in love with a small, hard-bitten Australian who used to delight only in winding them up. \"The Grand Slam is on, isn't it?\" grinned Jones on Saturday night, eschewing the caution and caveats more familiar to men with his job. \"All we need to do is prepare well. We prepare well, we play well, we win the game.\" Simple.

{"article": "The dense forests of Latvia do not usually echo with the sound of soldiers barking orders in broad Scouse, Mancunian or Lancastrian accents. But that was certainly the case last week during Nato's \"Exercise Silver Arrow\". Two hundred and fifty soldiers from The 2nd Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (known as 2LANCS) have been taking part in an operation the alliance has used to reacquaint itself with its core role -  safeguarding the freedom and security of its member states. It follows years of peacekeeping and counter insurgency elsewhere. Helicopter gunships and jet fighters roared overhead in the clear blue skies as 2LANCS infantrymen engaged the \"enemy\" amongst the larch and birch trees. Kingsman Dale Williams from Cumbria, a veteran of Afghanistan like most of his colleagues, described Exercise Silver Arrow as being worth its weight in gold. He said: \"We're going back to the old style\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6in wooded areas and so on. We've been doing a lot of gun training because we've got a lot of new lads in our gun platoon.\" The exercise is also designed to send a strong message to Moscow. When troops loyal to Russia took control of Crimea in southern Ukraine, it triggered the biggest crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War. Nato has said it \"stands with Ukraine\" in the face of Russia's \"destabilising\" influence., and called on Russia to stop the \"illegal\" annexation of the region. Latvia also has a sizeable Russian population. By holding Exercise Silver Arrow Nato hopes to show it's also serious about the defence of its most recent members in Eastern Europe, Latvia included. 2LANCS' commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Hamish McCormack, said their presence sent a message of reassurance to all of the Baltic states. \"It's not just this exercise but all of the other exercises that have been taking place in Estonia and will take place later this year in Poland,\" he said. Out in the forests surrounding the Adazi base near the Latvian capital Riga, soldiers were firing blanks - and laser beams. Sensors built into their fatigues told them if they'd been 'killed' or 'wounded'. While no-one died, it was deadly serious. Corporal Mick Cousins, from Liverpool, said regimental prestige played its part. \"There's a lot of pride at stake. Everyone wants to win. They've got that fighting spirit in them you know. Especially Chindit Company, 2LANCS. We're not used to losing.\" The exercise saw 2LANCS fighting alongside forces from Latvia and the US as 'friendlies'. Norwegians and Estonians played the role of 'the enemy' in this battle group-sized event. Kingsman Daniel Richardson from Blackpool said: \"Afghan was a bit more real than this. But it feels good to work with Nato allies and seeing things that they do and how it comes together.\" Dilapidated site To some, Adazi might seem an ironic location for Nato's exercise headquarters. The Union Flag and the regimental banner flew above a base that two decades ago would have been filled with Russian-made tanks - their guns trained west, ready to defend the old Soviet Union and its satellites against Nato forces. Now it's a dilapidated site. But it did at least provide shelter for 2LANCS' headquarters and the logistics staff. While electricity was in short supply and there was only basic accommodation, there was at least hot food and water. By contrast, the soldiers in the field were forced to endure conditions they'd expect for real. A week on army rations and a total absence of washing facilities other than those they carried in their kit. For them, it was a minor issue. Kingsman Jack Urban from Bolton summed it up: \"I'm not really bothered about that. I'm used to it. It's what we do. I miss my missus much more.\" Soldiers from 2LANCS were challenged and Chindit Company unexpectedly encountered 'enemy fire' and suffered 'heavy losses'. But in the end, the regiment 'prevailed'. As the shouting subsided and the guns fell silent, Lieutenant Colonel McCormack said it proved they could do what they have been trained to do. \"We've proved that to ourselves, our partners and anyone else who's watching.\"", "question": "Hundreds of soldiers from the North West have taken part in a huge Nato exercise in Latvia .

It confirmed its status as the awards circuit's second favourite film with six Independent Spirit Awards. La La Land wasn't eligible for the awards, which reward low-budget films. Moonlight was made for $1.5m (\u00c2\u00a31.2m) over 25 days - but has now recouped $21.5m (\u00c2\u00a317.3m) at the North American box office. It also has eight Oscar nominations, compared with La La Land's 14. In his acceptance speech, Casey Affleck, who won best male lead, gave a taste of the political tone that is likely to dominate the Oscars. He told the ceremony: \"The policies of this administration are abhorrent and they will not last. They're really un-American. \"I know this feels preachy and boring and I'm preaching to the choir but I'm just lending my little voice to the chorus here.\" British actress Naomie Harris, who appears in Moonlight, said the current political climate is \"definitely going to be reflected\" at the Oscars. \"Really great art reflects society,\" she told BBC News. \"It also edifies us. It shows us a different way of operating. So I definitely think it's going to be a very political year this year at the Oscars.\" She also said Moonlight has struck a chord because it has fed \"our universal yearning for connection\".

It's not heartfelt connection. \"And that's what we're all longing for, and I think that, in Moonlight, is what's demonstrated.\" The Independent Spirits ceremony is the traditional precursor to the Oscars and is one of the awards season's more informal events.

{"article": "A drug called mephedrone was causing so many health problems its importation had been banned in Guernsey, while the Jersey authorities had criminalised its possession and supply, pre-empting the Home Office, which was still in the process of taking advice on whether the drug should be controlled in the UK under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. At Guernsey Prison, I was told more than a third of inmates were addicted to mephedrone, which was said to have a similar effect to amphetamines, ecstasy or cocaine and whose side effects included psychosis, weight loss and insomnia. When the story appeared, some people questioned whether I had exaggerated what was happening, misinterpreted the evidence or confused mephedrone for the similar-sounding, but completely different, heroin-substitute methadone. In fact what I had reported on was the tip of a drugs iceberg which included a range of new psychoactive substances (NPS), known as \"legal highs\", synthetic chemicals which mimic the effects of illegal drugs. They were legal to possess and supply, but had the potential to cause mood swings and sudden changes in behaviour. The iceberg has continued to grow.  In 2011, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, the government's official drugs advice panel, said the advent of NPS had \"changed the face of the drug scene remarkably and with rapidity\". By last year, Nick Hardwick, then Chief Inspector of Prisons for England and Wales, declared that NPS represented the \"most serious threat\" to the security of the prison system. And last week, the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board said the emergence of NPS was \"undiminished\" and a \"public health challenge\", with 602 new types of the drug reported in 2015 - 5% more than the year before. The government's main response to NPS has been to outlaw them: 500 substances, including mephedrone, now fall under the Misuse of Drugs Act. But if the aim was to stop the spread of NPS, then the approach has failed.  As each drug is made illegal, the chemical structures are tweaked to create a new substance which falls outside the legislation. The new substance is on the market so quickly that its health and social harms can't be assessed and action taken to disrupt the supply. So, the government is trying something radically different - the significance of which has not yet been fully appreciated. From 6 April, sweeping new powers will come into force in the UK making it an offence to produce or supply any substance intended for human consumption that can produce a psychoactive effect. It's a reversal of the current system, under which drugs are prohibited only after they've been identified, tested and evaluated.  In future, the only psychoactive substances that won't be banned are those that have already been specifically excluded. People who break the new law could find themselves jailed for seven years. Given the blanket nature of the measures and the severity of the possible sanctions it is not surprising they had a rather turbulent passage through Parliament. Some have compared the law to the Dangerous Dogs Act, the infamous 1991 legislation, drafted at speed in response to a string of attacks on people by aggressive dogs. One problem is the term \"psychoactive substance\".  It is defined in the Act as something that \"affects the person's mental functioning or emotional state\", a description that appears to be deliberately wide and vague. How would it be applied to new substances whose psychoactivity has yet to be tested? Could harmless herbal products or strong spices be caught up?  Expect a few courtroom battles over that. Another difficulty is the exemptions list: alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, medicines, food, drink and drugs that are already controlled are on it. But \"poppers\", chemicals popular among gay men to enhance their sexual experience, are not - a decision described as \"fantastically stupid\" by Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, a poppers user. A third issue relates to sentencing. Although people caught with NPS for their own use won't be punished, the penalties for production and supply don't, on the face of it, appear to distinguish between different types of psychoactive substances, a concern raised by the Home Affairs Committee and in the House of Lords. That may well lead to a stream of appeals by those who feel they have been unfairly sentenced, though the Home Office says sanctions will be proportionate to the drugs which cause the most harm. Of course, the fact that NPS will be subject to an automatic ban and possible criminal sanctions is likely to send a strong message about the dangers of the drugs - and may act as a deterrent: greater public awareness of the risks is one of the aims of the legislation. But will the measures themselves succeed in reducing availability and consumption? Even the Home Office acknowledges there is no hard evidence yet to support that from the countries with comparable systems - the Republic of Ireland, Romania and Poland. In its \"impact assessment\" document about the measures, prepared in May 2015, officials said \"no formal evaluation\" had been completed in any of the three nations, though it pointed out that hundreds of head-shops, which are thought to have sold NPS, had closed. The BBC later reported, however, that Irish police found it hard to bring prosecutions under their new legislation - a problem which could also beset British law enforcement agencies, given the law has been modelled on Ireland's. The Home Office impact assessment says there is \"considerable uncertainty\" about the impact of the ban on businesses which sell NPS because they occupy a \"grey area\" between the licit and illicit drugs markets. It accepts there is a risk users will turn to the internet and organised crime groups to obtain NPS, or even switch to substances that are banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Nevertheless, it estimates there will be 12 fewer NPS-related deaths each year - though quite how officials arrived at that figure is unclear. If lives were to be saved, health costs reduced and harm to communities diminished, the architects of this ground-breaking legislation would no doubt claim it to be a success. In England and Wales in 2014, there were 67 deaths linked to new psychoactive substances - treble the number in 2010, when I made that visit to Guernsey. But NPS are just a small part of a far bigger drugs problem which claimed 3346 lives in 2014. Most of the deaths were caused by the abuse of opiates such as heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and tranquilisers. According to the Office for National Statistics it was the highest number of drug-related deaths since comparable records began in 1993. That alarming fact makes the need for a renewed focus on the drug problem more urgent than ever - indeed, the Home Office is \"refreshing\" its five-year drugs strategy, with a new version to be published in the coming weeks. But the new strategy is likely to be similar to what is already in place, which is why there will be more attention on the hugely controversial Psychoactive Substances Act: the critics will be watching closely.", "question": "Six years ago this month , I reported from the Channel Islands on a disturbing new @placeholder .", "option_0": "era", "option_1": "phenomenon", "option_2": "show", "option_3": "issue", "option_4": "footing", "label": 1}
{"article": "Birstall, a large village about five miles from Leeds, is in gridlock. On the approach to its centre, blockades warn of road closures ahead. The market place - often a hive of retail activity - is as packed as it would be on any other Friday, except today it is lined with the world's press. \"We want Birstall to be famous, but not for this,\" says resident Ian Blaimers, 69. He and lifelong friend Brian Doyle, 72, are standing across the road from where the town's MP, Jo Cox, was shot and stabbed just 24 hours ago. \"I had planned to go see her at 1pm,\" Mr Blaimers says. \"At 12.30 I changed my mind. I thought, 'I'll see her another time'.\" He stares across the street, where police officers are carrying out a fingertip search outside the library. \"If I hadn't changed my mind, I would've been in the middle of it.\" Blue police tape is wrapped in great loops around lampposts surrounding the square. Cameramen jostle for what limited space there is left to set up their tripods. \"Depressed, is the word,\" says Mr Doyle. \"We've lost someone special.\" Journalists outnumber the residents on Birstall's streets. Those who have come out are wary of the intrusion. \"You're the third reporter to come up to me in the last five minutes,\" one lady says. She looks close to tears. \"You expect this in big cities but not here. It's just a quiet, little place. \"It's going to take a long time to recover from,\" she says before heading back inside the shop where she works. \"It's not just shock it happened, it's shock it happened here,\" says Sarah Lyle, 44. She and her friend have just dropped their children off at nursery. They are just one of the many clusters of people gathering at the edges of the town to reflect on what's happened. \"This is a small community, people think of this place as a village, and Jo was such a big figure in that.\" She shakes her head. \"It's just so surreal.\" \"The community is scared,\" adds Jessica Clarkson, 27. \"I didn't want to send my kids to school today because it's on the estate where [the alleged attacker] lives.\" Her friend, Jodie Britton, 29, rocks her child's pushchair and nods at the media scrum. \"We only voted Jo in a year ago, I think she was one of five people we could choose from - that's how much the community thought of her,\" she says. The baby drops a milk bottle on the floor and, as she leans to pick it up, she adds: \"I really don't think people will get over it.\" Another resident, who did not want to be named, was possibly more shocked than anyone to hear how the mother-of-two was shot and stabbed on Thursday. He knows the suspect. \"When his image came up on the screen me and my wife said, 'not in a million years'. Of all the people in Birstall that I know, he would've been at the bottom of the list.\" The 66-year-old has lived in the town his whole life and, for many years, across the road from suspect Tommy Mair.

A steady stream of people are walking towards the town centre clutching bouquets of flowers ready to be laid just yards from where Mrs Cox was killed. As helicopters thump overhead and police officers guard every corner, it would be easy to paint Birstall as a village shattered. But among the feelings of sadness and fear are those of resoluteness - a desire to come back stronger once the turmoil fades. Sonya Archer, 44, believes it is what Mrs Cox would have wanted most of all. \"Everyone is devastated, but the positives need to come out of this, particularly because that's what she stood for. \"She was a champion for communities and this will make us go from strength to strength. \"We will move forward.\"", "question": "Caring , hard - working , @placeholder to the people .

{"article": "Until - perhaps - now. Next week, the Large Hadron Collider at Cern will be fired up again after a two-year programme of maintenance and upgrading. When it is, the energy with which it smashes particles will be twice what it was during the LHC's Higgs boson-discovering glory days. It is anticipated - hoped, even - that this increased capability might finally reveal the identity of \"dark matter\" - an invisible but critical entity that makes up about a quarter of the Universe. This is the topic of this week's Horizon programme on BBC Two. Dark matter arrived on most scientists' radar in 1974 thanks to the observations of American astronomer Vera Rubin, who noticed that stars orbiting the gravity-providing black holes at the centre of spiral galaxies like ours did so at the same speed regardless of their distance from the centre. This shouldn't happen - and doesn't happen in apparently comparable systems like our Solar System, where planets trapped by the gravity of the sun orbit increasingly slowly the further away they find themselves. Neptune takes 165 Earth years to plod around the Sun just once. This is what our understanding of gravity tells us should happen. Vera's stars racing around at the same speed were a surprise: there had to be more stuff there - providing more gravity - than we could see. Dark matter. Dark matter, then, is a generic term for the stuff (matter) that must be there but which we can't see (dark). But as to what this dark matter might actually be, so far science has drawn a blank. That's not to say that there's been no progress at all. It's now thought that dark matter isn't just ordinary stuff in the form of gas and dust and dead stars that are dark simply because they don't shine. It's now generally agreed that the dark matter is a miasma of (as yet unidentified) fundamental particles like (but not) the quarks and gluons, and so on, that make up the atoms with which we're more familiar. These \"dark\" fundamental particles are known as Wimps: Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. This acronym, like the term \"dark matter\" itself, is a description of how these theoretical dark matter creatures behave, rather than a definition of what they are: The \"weakly interacting\" bit means that they don't have much to do with ordinary matter. They fly straight though it. This makes them very tricky to detect, given that ordinary matter is all we have to detect them with. The \"massive\" part means simply that they have mass. It has nothing to do with their size. All that's left is \"particle\", which means, for want of a better description, that it's a thing. So dark matter is some form of fundamental particle that has Wimp characteristics. In theory, these Wimps could be a huge range of different things, but work done by Prof Carlos Frenk of Durham University has narrowed the search somewhat. It was Frenk and his colleagues who, at the start of their scientific careers in the 1980s, announced that dark matter had to be of the Wimp type and, additionally, it had to be \"cold\". At the time, it was a controversial claim, but in the years since, Frenk has added computerised flesh to the bones of the theory - by making universes. \"It's quite a simple process,\" says Frenk. \"All you need is gravity and a few basic assumptions.\" Key among these basic assumptions is Frenk's claim that dark matter is of the Wimp variety, and cold. The universes that emerge from his computer are indistinguishable from our own, providing a lot of support to the idea of cold dark matter. And because dark matter is part of the simulation, it can be made visible. The un-seeable revealed. \"You can almost touch it!\" enthuses Frenk. But so far, \"almost\" is the issue. The fact is that you can't touch it - which is why tracking it down \"in the wild\" has, to date, ended in disappointment. And yet it must be there, and it must be a fundamental particle - which is where Cern's Large Hadron Collider comes in. What happens in the LHC is that protons are fired around its 27km-long tube in opposite directions. Once they've been  accelerated to almost the speed of light, they're collided - smashed together. This does two things. Firstly, it makes the protons disintegrate, revealing the quarks, gluons and gauge bosons and the other fundamental particles of atomic matter. There are 17 particles in the standard model of particle physics - and all of them have been seen at the LHC. Secondly, the collisions might produce other, heavier particles. When they do, the LHC's detectors will record them. In charge of one of those detectors is Prof Dave Charlton from the University of Birmingham. \"Sometimes you produce much more massive particles. These are the guys we're looking for.\" Dave - and everyone else at Cern - is looking for them because they could be the particles that could be the dark matter. It all sounds highly unlikely - the idea that ordinary matter produces matter you can't see or detect with the matter that made it - but it makes sense in terms of the uncontroversial concept of the Big Bang. If dark matter exists, it would have been produced at the Big Bang like everything else. And to see what actually was produced at the big bang, you need to create the conditions of the Big Bang - and the only place you're likely to get anywhere near those conditions is at the point of collision in the LHC. The faster the collision, the closer you get to the Big Bang temperature. So there's every reason to think that dark matter might well be produced in particle accelerators like the LHC. What's more, there's a mathematical theory that predicts that the 17 constituents of the standard model are matched by 17 more particles. This is based on a principle called \"super symmetry\". Prof John Ellis, a theoretical physicist from Kings College, London, who also works at Cern, is a fan of super symmetry. He's hopeful that some of these as yet theoretical super symmetrical particles will show up soon. \"We were kind of hoping that they'd show up in the first run of the LHC. But they didn't,\" he confesses, ruefully. Ellis explains that what that means is that the super symmetric particles must be heavier than they thought, and they will only appear at higher energies than have been available - until now. In the LHC's second run, its collisions will occur with twice as much energy, giving Prof Ellis hope that the super symmetric particles might finally appear. \"When we increase the energy of the LHC, we'll be able to look further - produce heavier super symmetric particles, if they exist. Let's see what happens!\" It's crunch time for super symmetry. If it shows itself in the LHC, then all will be well. The dark matter problem would finally be solved, along with some other anomalies in the standard model of physics. But if, like last time, super symmetry fails to turn up, physicists and astrophysicists will have to come up with some other ideas for what our Universe is made from. \"It might be,\" concedes Prof Ellis, \"that we'll have to scratch our heads and start again.\" Dancing in the Dark - The End of Physics? is broadcast on BBC Two on Tuesday 17 March at 21:00.", "question": "They say the hardest pieces of music to perform are often the simplest ones .

{"article": "Every year, 100,000 women die from massive bleeding in the moments after giving birth. But an international study, in the Lancet, suggests \"tranexamic acid\" could cut that by a third. Postpartum haemorrhage is the biggest cause of death during pregnancy and early motherhood. \"They gave me 41 bottles of blood,\" said Nosheen, from Rawalpindi, in Pakistan who nearly died after the birth of her daughter. Nosheen's life was saved only by an emergency hysterectomy. She told the BBC World Service's Health Check programme: \"Doctors told me that they will have to remove my uterus to save my life. \"My health is completely destroyed, and I am very upset about it.\" Tranexamic acid might have helped Nosheen. It stops blood clots breaking down to make it easier for the body to stem bleeding. It was invented by husband and wife Shosuke and Utako Okamoto in Japan in the 1960s. But they could not convince local doctors to perform a clinical trial for postpartum haemorrhage. So instead it was picked up by a pharmaceutical company and used as a treatment for heavy periods. And there the story nearly ended. Eventually, a study was coordinated by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a collaboration of 193 hospitals mostly in Africa and Asia. Prof Utako Okamoto died, aged 98, just after the 20,000th and final patient was enrolled on to the trial that would finally prove she had been right. It found tranexamic acid cut deaths by a fifth overall and by 31% in those given the drug within three hours of birth. Prof Ian Roberts, one of the researchers, told the BBC: \"We've got an important result. \"We found an inexpensive drug, given in a single shot, that reduces the risk of bleeding to death, and it should play a role in reducing maternal mortality around the world.\" The World Health Organization said is would update its recommendations for treating postpartum haemorrhage treatment. The findings would not have been a surprise to Utako. The UK team went to visit the \"physically small, but so switched-on firecracker\" near the start of the trial. Her husband had already died. In a film they made, she told them: \"It's going to be good, it's going to be effective. \"Without doing the research, I know it will be effective.\" 77% of maternal deaths are in just 20 countries 1,360 mothers die per 100,000 births in Sierra Leone Colombia: 64 deaths per 100,000 Greece, Poland, Finland: Three maternal deaths per 100,000 In the poverty of post-War Japan, she and her husband decided to start researching blood because they could donate their own samples to study. \"We wanted to work on something international, we wanted to discover new drugs to show our gratitude to humanity,\" she said. \"We thought that would be wonderful.\" Prof Roberts says he was blown away and inspired by her and this is not the end of the journey. The drug might be cheap, but getting it into hospitals around the world will still be a challenge. Prof Roberts added: \"It is an awful thing for a mother to die in childbirth. \"When we started the trial, the staff would cry hearing about babies left without their mothers. \"Making sure the treatment is available everywhere it can save a life is hugely important. \"We shouldn't have children growing up without a mother for lack of a drug that costs a dollar.\" Dr Rizwana Chaudri, from Rawalpindi Medical College, said: \"Women dying of postpartum haemorrhage, women brought dead to the hospital, there's so many of them. \"You can't even think of that in a developed world, but over here this is a daily thing that goes on and on and on.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "question": "A cheap drug has been shown to stop women bleeding to death , in a discovery that should change @placeholder around the world , say researchers .", "option_0": "conditions", "option_1": "control", "option_2": "practice", "option_3": "answers", "option_4": "lives", "label": 2}
{"article": "The Birmingham bombs did not come out of nowhere. It is important to understand the political context and climate of the time in 1974. There had just been a general election that saw Harold Wilson - whose policy on Ireland was to reunify the country by peaceful means - returned to power. This gave the IRA some encouragement a political deal to achieve their goal of \"Brits Out\" might be in the offing. To further that seeming encouragement, throughout 1974 there had been secret back-channel talks between the British government and the IRA's ruling Army Council - brokered by the MI6 officer, Michael Oatley - via an intermediary who was trusted by both sides. The IRA wanted to pile the military pressure on the Brits in the autumn of 1974 with a view, in their eyes, to negotiate from a position of strength. The IRA did the same nearly 20 years later in the lead up to the IRA ceasefire of 1994 and the subsequent Good Friday Agreement, in 1998. In October 1974, as part of that pressure, the IRA bombed a pub in Guildford used by the army, killing four soldiers. Birmingham would seem to fit the same pattern - except The Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs were not military targets. By and large, with notable exceptions, the IRA did not deliberately go out to slaughter innocent civilians, unlike Al Qaeda and so-called Islamic State. Birmingham seems to have been a locally-generated IRA attack, not authorised by the IRA's England Department in Dublin. I was told many years ago that it was probably ordered by a local IRA commander as a revenge attack for the way he believed the city had gloated over the death of an IRA man, James McDaid, who had blown himself up with his own bomb a week before the attacks on the Birmingham pubs. I remember interviewing Billy McKee, who had just been released from jail and was the commander of the IRA's Belfast Brigade, in the autumn of 1974 and a member of the IRA's ruling Army Council. He told me he knew nothing about the attacks which were carried out by a local IRA unit that was not authorised at the highest level of the organisation. McKee said he had only heard a month later that the IRA was responsible. McKee said: \"I never approved of civilian loss of life. \"I don't mind our own people and the 'Brits' [the security forces] going down, but I didn't agree with ordinary civilian people losing their lives.\" Although some people appear to know the identities of the surviving bombers, it is unlikely they will be charged as the evidence to bring a prosecution probably does not exist more than 40 years on. What is likely to come out of the new inquest is the extent to which West Midlands Police may have received warnings - possibly from sources within the local IRA - and failed to act.

SNP MP George Kerevan raised the question during PMQs, asking Mrs May whether there had been any \"official conversations\" about giving Mr Farage a peerage.

There's a process to be followed. \"You will have heard the prime minister talk in October about her views on the honours system and making sure that it recognises people who really contribute to society and their communities.\" Supporters of the move point to UKIP's record in elections - it comfortably won the 2014 European elections, got the third largest vote share in last year's general election, and achieved its long-held goal of an EU exit in June's referendum. Despite its vote share, UKIP has been left with just one MP and three members of the House of Lords - and these all switched allegiance to the party - compared with the Lib Dems' 104. Supporters say this is unfair and means the party is under-represented. Mr Farage has been promoting his own role recently, offering his services to the government as an intermediary to Mr Trump. However, in July he said his \"political ambition has been achieved\" with the Brexit vote. It's not too surprising that support for Mr Farage's peerage comes from UKIP leadership contenders Paul Nuttall and Suzanne Evans - perhaps more so that former Green Party leader Natalie Bennett also backs his elevation to the Lords. \"No matter how deeply we disagree with UKIP's politics, they should also be far better represented in the House of Lords,\" she said last year. Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the BBC he would have put Mr Farage in the Lords after the general election. Although life peers are appointed by the Queen, it is the prime minister who nominates them. The leader of the opposition and other party leaders are also given a set allocation, but UKIP does not, which has long been a bone of contention with Mr Farage's party. One-off announcements can also be made by the government to award peerages to people appointed as ministers who are not MPs.", "question": "He has been in the European Parliament since 1999 , @placeholder to get elected to Westminster seven times , and recently made it to Trump Tower as a guest of the US president - elect .", "option_0": "designed", "option_1": "promising", "option_2": "failed", "option_3": "returned", "option_4": "appears", "label": 2}
{"article": "Greece is now part way through its third eurozone bailout programme, worth up to 86bn euros (\u00c2\u00a374bn). The programme has encountered repeated delays as the lenders monitor compliance with policy conditions. Technical officials are expected to return to Athens soon to complete the negotiations. The \"in principle\" deal, as European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici called it, was agreed at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Malta. The main elements in the latest agreement are commitments to reduce spending on pensions from 2019 and to collect more income tax from 2020 by lowering the tax-free threshold. Together the two measures are intended to improve the Greek government's finances by the equivalent of 2% of the country's economic activity, or GDP. To sweeten a pill that will be unpopular in Greece, the other eurozone countries agreed that Athens would be able take other measures to stimulate the economy, if the government finances perform better than expected. The next step is that technical experts from three European institutions and the IMF will return to Athens to try to negotiate the remaining details. The Dutch Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs eurozone ministers' meetings, called for them to put the last dots on the i's and reach a full agreement as soon as possible at staff level - that's the staff of the institutions involved in monitoring the programme. That is needed before there is political decision to make that delayed payment. Once there is a staff agreement, Mr Dijsselbloem said that the Eurogroup ministers would also look at the targets Greece would need to aim for in the  government finances after the last bailout payments are made (due in 2018) and the question of debt sustainability - which means debt relief beyond what the eurozone has already provided. Debt relief previously has been in the form of reduced interest rates and longer payment periods, rather than reducing the amount of the principal sum that must ultimately be repaid. Further debt relief is likely to be in a similar form. Eurozone ministers have said it many times and it's politically more difficult for them with domestic political audiences if they were to explicitly write off a chunk of what they have lent. The International Monetary Fund has long argued that Greece needs more debt relief. That has been behind its reluctance to contribute financially to the third bailout. (It did chip in to the first two). Its involvement in the third so far is as an adviser and monitor of Greek performance. The rest of the eurozone, but especially Germany, would like the IMF to put some money in. That's not so much for the sake of reducing the eurozone contribution as for the better credibility they think the programme would have if the IMF did stump up some money. But IMF staff are so far unwilling to even recommend it to their board, which is made up of representatives of the agency's member countries. After the Malta meeting, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said:  \"We are at a point where we think there are good prospects for successfully concluding discussions on these outstanding policy issues during the next mission to Athens. \"Such an agreement on policies will have to be followed by discussions with euro-area countries to ensure satisfactory assurances on a credible strategy to restore debt sustainability, before a programme is presented to the IMF executive board.\" The key deadline for the next instalment from the eurozone is July. Greece needs additional funds for debt payments that fall due. In Athens, the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said: \"The Greek economy is ready to leave the crisis behind it.\" But there is a lot of scepticism about that. Hugo Dixon of BreakingViews says that the current discussion will only buy Greece some more time, until mid-2018.

{"article": "Even at 80 years old, Woody Allen is too young to remember the glittering Cafe Society of the 1920s and '30s that both informs his latest film and gives its title. Yet that has not stopped him recreating the nightclubs, jazz bars and pool parties of this bygone era, in a film in which movie stars and Hollywood moguls rub shoulders with criminals and bootleggers. The result is a film of pronounced juxtapositions: One in which a scene of tuxedoed and glamorously gowned socialites can slip into another in which a man is shot in the head in a barber's chair. Could this be seen as Allen's homage to Martin Scorsese, another New York film-maker with a distinctive personal style, whose work abounds with such nefarious mayhem? \"I should be so lucky!\" he exclaims. One certainly does not expect a Woody Allen film to feature dead bodies being disposed of in wet concrete, or it to have a character who ultimately meets his maker via the electric chair. \"Oh no, [but] you should,\" he says with mock indignation. \"Right from the start, [in 1969's] Take the Money and Run - even though it was a silly picture, I played a gangster. \"I made Match Point, which was a murder picture, as was Cassandra's Dream and Irrational Man and Manhattan Murder Mystery. \"I'm not graphic in general, but here it was indicated. I was writing about my [New York Jewish] background, and that was what happened.\" Born in the Bronx and raised in Brooklyn, the director - born Allan Stewart Konigsberg - entered the world on 1 December 1935 - just five weeks after the Jewish-American gangster Dutch Schultz violently left it. In Cafe Society, the romantic travails of youthful Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg) are largely kept separate from the more ruthless activities of his brother Ben (Corey Stoll). It is clear, however, that Allen's overall intention is to create a picaresque tableau - one in which the choices people make have a profound impact on whether they will ever achieve or experience lasting happiness. Kristen Stewart's character Vonnie - a fresh-faced young studio secretary who is torn between Eisenberg's bashful ardour and the more seasoned attentions of a married movie star agent (Steve Carell) - is a case in point. Which man she chooses will have massive repercussions not just for her respective paramours, but also a wealthy young woman named Veronica (Blake Lively) who comes to share more than Vonnie's (albeit abbreviated) name. Stewart, known to millions for her Bella Swan role in the Twilight film series, admits Vonnie's \"mannerisms and demeanour are pretty outside of [her] more immediate go-to personality traits\". \"But I'm far from a character actor, and Vonnie was definitely in there somewhere - I wasn't faking it. \"The movie would only work if she had this really contagious, enticing and inviting willingness to be impulsive - to live in the moment and appreciate life in a shameless, non-judgemental way. \"For a story told in the context of that era, it's really forward and cool and modern that she can indulge in unconventional relationships and not feel bad about it at a time when young respectable women were supposed to do very particular things.\" For Eisenberg, the chance to travel back in time was as much of an attraction as the opportunity to work again with Allen, a director he collaborated with previously on the 2012 portmanteau comedy To Rome with Love. \"It's a surreal experience,\" he explains. \"You enter into a different time period, a romantic glamour that doesn't exist anymore. \"You mourn the loss of that sweet formality, if not the horrible poverty, racism and sexism. At the same time, the clothes were nicer.\" Eisenberg's own mannerisms and demeanour inevitably recall those of Allen, the role of Bobby being one it would easy to imagine him playing at the beginning of his career. The Social Network and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice star says he tried to make \"the character [his] own\", while conceding it was difficult not to let some of Allen's familiar inflections seep into his portrayal. \"It's written by Woody Allen, it's written in his style and cadence [and] he's standing a foot from me every day giving me direction,\" the 32-year-old shrugs. \"I think it's impossible not to be inspired or affected by him subconsciously, even though I made every conscious effort to avoid it.\" Soon to celebrate his 81st birthday, Allen's ability to secure financing for his projects without surrendering artistic control makes him an anomaly in today's Hollywood. He's had his ups and downs, many of the latter as a consequence of his turbulent personal life. Cafe Society, though, shows his working routine to be as robust and as streamlined as ever. \"When I finish a script I never have to show it to anybody,\" he reveals. \"I never have to get any approval for it or approval of casting. \"I raise the money privately, so I make the movie I want to make and then I hope people like it. \"As a director, I would not have liked to work in Hollywood in the '30s, because the studio ruled film-makers and told them who to cast and what scripts they had to do. \"I've been very blessed, very lucky - and I've never had to argue for final cut.\" Woody Allen, Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart were speaking at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

Around 100 complaints had come into the BBC 24 hours after it went out, with numbers rising on Tuesday. The BBC said: \"We take audibility seriously and we will look at the sound levels on the programme in time for the next episode.\" The drama stars Sam Riley as an officer working simultaneously with the Nazis and the British Resistance. Some viewers took to Twitter to air their views on the sound levels. One user Luanne wrote: \"I am 12 minutes into SS-GB & I'm turning on the subtitles. All this tough guy, breathy, growling, mumbling, I can't understand you!\" TV critic Emma Bullimore told the BBC: \"We are living in astonishingly ambitious times for TV drama, attracting world class talent to the small screen, and sometimes this means the basics of storytelling get slightly overlooked - either in terms of audibility or making a story too complicated or difficult to follow (as Sherlock was criticised for). \"However, it does feel that mumbling is the latest bandwagon for BBC bashers to jump on and the odd muffled word gets spun into a story. Actually, my enjoyment of SS-GB wasn't marred by sound issues.\" It's not the first time the issue of mumbling on TV dramas has been raised, with past programmes such as Jamaica Inn and Happy Valley having hit the headlines over the audio. Back in 2013, the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, told the Radio Times: \"I don't want to sound like a grumpy old man but I think muttering is something we could look at.\" Analysis - do flat TVs mean flat sound? Leo Kelion, technology desk editor As televisions get thinner, their makers have less space to build in speakers unless they opt to add sound equipment to the sides and/or below the screens, threatening to make them look less \"sleek\". In many cases families might be best advised to buy a separate soundbar or speaker system. This isn't just the case for budget TVs. In many cases manufacturers assume those that can afford the higher-end models will invest in the extra technology. Sony recently took a new approach to the problem with a TV that has no dedicated speakers but rather produces sound by vibrating the OLED screen itself. The jury is still out on how well that works. But in general, if the vast majority of programmes on yours set sound fine and only a few don't, then the problem is likely to be with how they have been mixed rather than the TVs themselves. Speaking on the Today programme, ITV's Victoria creator, Daisy Goodwin, pointed out that Riley may have made a conscious choice to not speak with perfectly clear diction in keeping with his character.

{"article": "It wasn't so much \"here's a rabbit from the hat\" but more: \"look over there - a squirrel!\" So, with some nasty new forecasts, and without big changes in the near-term tax and spending totals, George Osborne opted to look busy - taking from bigger business and particularly the soft drink firms that put sugar into their fizz, while giving to smaller business, savers and higher rate income tax payers. He got busy at a very local level, even finding \u00a35m from banker fines to build a leisure centre in Helensburgh. He halved tolls on the Severn Bridge and he's upgrading trunk roads across northern England (which ought to be very welcome to Scottish hauliers). Meanwhile, as the Chancellor was flunking some of his own fiscal tests, this Budget flunked a test that others had set him - to simplify the UK's horribly complex taxation system. By the time we find out if the claims of getting to a fiscal surplus, using 2020 vision, we'll surely have long forgotten the Budget of 16 March 2016. While Mr Osborne sounds confident about getting to a \u00a310bn surplus, the forecasts on which he is basing that have widely divergent possible outcomes. He is going with the central one. But if you look at the forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility, it has a 'fan diagram' showing the wide range of possible growth outcomes. The variation is not only for 2020, but for 2016 - ranging between growth of a sizzling 3.8% and contraction of a dismal 0.2%. So as forecasts are near certain to be wrong, how instead might this Budget be remembered? Perhaps for something that George Osborne only briefly mentioned - productivity. It's turned out disappointingly again. And that's knocked back the growth estimates for the economy, as well as for pay, for tax revenue, and for company profits over the rest of the decade. Britain's not alone in that. But keeping company with the USA on such numbers is not that reassuring. While George Osborne didn't say much about productivity, the Office for Budget Responsibility did. It was OBR numbers that forced the Chancellor into that fancy financial footwork. With its forecast last November, the OBR had taken healthy signs of productivity growth from the middle two quarters of last year, and projected them forward. However, the fourth quarter pushed productivity backwards by 1.2%, eliminating the progress made in the previous six months. Having assumed 1.4% growth over three quarters, it ended up with nothing. Duly chastened, the OBR turned more pessimistic this month, and reckons productivity will continue to drag. Back in 2010, when it was set up, the independent forecaster expected productivity to grow by 22% over the course of this decade. It now thinks that will be more like 14.5%. The US Congressional Budget Office, equivalent to the OBR, has revised forecasts down to a slightly greater extent. And as that is the main, long-term driver of real pay, it means Britain's standard of living will improve from the recession, but at only two thirds of the rate we've come to expect. So over the rest of this decade, the forecast for the average annual rate of growth in output has been lowered from 4.3% to 3.7%. Pay is expected to grow by 3.9% per year on average, down 0.4% points from the November forecast, and mainly due to low productivity. Similarly, profits (non-oil and non-financial) are due to grow by 3.5% on average, down from 4.6% forecast in November. This sluggish productivity continues to puzzle economists. As highlighted in my previous blog, the value of output per hour ought to be improving as the workforce deploys higher skill levels coming out of university. And surely if employers are recruiting as enthusiastically as they have done in the past few years, that ought to be a sign that they are running out of slack with which to fulfil growing order books. But it's not. One part of the explanation can be found in the oil and gas industry, which has productivity 12 times higher than the economy as a whole.  Gas and electricity utilities are four times higher. (Tourism is roughly half as high.) But it is these highly productive sectors that have seen the worst performance in productivity growth. The energy utilities have gone from 5% annual growth in the years before the Great Recession to 5% average declines. Oil and gas, counted under \"mining and quarrying\" by statisticians, has seen annual declines of nearly 6% as production has slipped and costs have soared. Manufacturing has held on to growth, but it's much slower than it was - down from 3.1% in the pre-crunch years to only 0.4% in the period from 2008 to 2015. For the big picture, across the British economy and between 1994 and the start of 2008, productivity grew by 1.9% in the average year. Remember: that was the key measure that drove up prosperity. But between early 2008 and the third quarter of 2015, it fell before its sluggish rise. The OBR tells us the average year saw only 0.1% per year. Economics logic suggests that this process will lead to the momentum in job creation running out of steam. At 5.1% unemployment in the March figures (published three hours before Mr Osborne started his Budget speech), covering the UK-wide Labour Force Survey in November to January, that is forecast to fall to 4.9%, and then to rise a bit. That is partly because the higher National Living Wage, from next month, is expected to cost jobs. (In Scotland, with higher unemployment in the March figures, it's now at 6.1%.) Talking of Scotland, a quick run through the other specific measures in the Budget. The hike in the starting rate for income tax, and for higher rate tax from April 2017, presents a challenge to the Scottish government in its 2017-18 budget. The basic rate threshold is controlled by Westminster, but its impact in Scotland falls on Holyrood. That is, at \u00a311,500, there will be less revenue once MSPs have control over income tax. So will there be compensation from Westminster, having pledged there will be 'no detriment' to Holyrood from decisions made by the Chancellor? Or will the next Scottish government have to cut its cloth to lower basic rate revenue. And what of higher rate tax?  Will MSPs want to raise the threshold at which people starting paying 40% income tax to \u00a345,000?  Listening to John Swinney's reaction, it seems not. But if he remains finance secretary, would he be content to see Scottish tax higher than the rest of the UK? He's sought to avoid that in the past. The Scottish government has prided itself on its rates relief for small business. But George Osborne has gone much further on that, while also pegging future rate rises to a lower measure of inflation. That means a sacrifice of tax revenue. Will Holyrood choose to do likewise, at a price? There are changes to Capital Gains Tax and tax on dividends which are tricksy for Holyrood. Because the tax rates for these are pitched well below the 40% higher rate of income tax, there will be an incentive for better-off business owners to take more of their earnings as dividends and capital gains than as pay. That would divert the payment of tax - from Holyrood, which gets the income tax element, to Westminster, which gets tax on dividends and capital gains. On oil and gas, it's easy to cut tax rates when hardly any profit is being made. The \"effective abolition\" of Petroleum Revenue Tax removes a higher rate of tax on older oil and gas fields. And with Supplementary Charge cut from 30% to 20%, it means a flat rate tax on profits of 40%. But due to high levels of investment and low profitability, the Treasury is seeing a reverse of the tax flow. The OBR forecast, on which it is now working, points to around \u00a31bn being repaid to oil and gas producers in each of the next few years. Think how that is going to look in future publications of Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland, or GERS - the document that last week showed a near \u00a315bn deficit for 2014-15. Whereas oil and gas has delivered many billions of revenue to GERS each year, the forecasts suggests, for the first time, an annual cost to a Scottish treasury (if it were to control offshore revenues) of perhaps \u00a3800m. A sugar levy is being introduced for public health reasons - giving the soft drinks industry a lead time of two years in which to lower sugar content, or pay a \u00a3500m annual price. So far, it has cross-party support. It had been seen as un-Conservative to intervene in the market so directly. But if a Tory Chancellor can meddle in the choices behind bad dietary habits, it opens the door to politicians at Holyrood - typically more interventionist - to target a broader range of choices.", "question": "This was a Budget with a message about the next @placeholder , and a massage of difficult underlying figures .", "option_0": "whistle", "option_1": "crash", "option_2": "decline", "option_3": "generation", "option_4": "machine", "label": 3}

{"article": "This article was first published on 15 March, 2016 No-one did more to glamorise and popularise professional golf than Arnold Palmer, the 86-year-old host of the invitational tournament that bears his name and which starts at Bay Hill on Thursday. Without his charismatic showmanship and commitment to the four majors, it is hard to imagine golf enjoying the status it does today. Tiger Woods has been one of the world's most eminent sportsmen in the past two decades, but the impact of the 14-time major champion's brilliance would not have been so great without the foundations laid by Palmer. Between 1958 and 1964, the man they called 'The King' won seven major titles and harnessed the new television era for golf as viewers fell in love with 'Arnie' and his heart-on-sleeve style. He was followed by hordes of fans on both sides of the Atlantic, who became known as Arnie's Army. This was especially significant because Palmer continued to travel to the UK for The Open at a time when many American pros were finding the oldest major rather inconvenient. But golf's biggest hero embraced the journey across the pond and in doing so breathed new life into The Open. The reward for his admirable perseverance was back-to-back Claret Jugs at Royal Birkdale and Royal Troon in 1961 and 1962. That latter victory, at this year's Open host, attracted the championship's strongest field since the days of Bobby Jones and Gene Sarazen, forever re-establishing the event's place among the majors. Jack Nicklaus may have come along to wrest the mantle of the sport's leading player from Palmer, but his fame never waned. To this day you can order an 'Arnold Palmer' and the bartender will know to pour an iced tea with lemonade. Even at the age of 86, he still ranks the fifth-highest earner in the game. According to Golf Digest's latest figures, Palmer's $40m income last year was beaten only by Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Woods and Rory McIlroy. Mr Palmer, as the players refer to him, has always been an energetic ambassador for his event, conspicuous on the range, the course, in the clubhouse and the press tent. But, sadly, this year he is likely to be less visible. \"I don't think his liveliness is quite there like it has been,\" his grandson Sam Saunders, a PGA Tour player, recently told ESPN. \"The one thing that will never go away is his toughness. He's not just going to lay down and not do anything. He'll still be out there trying to push it. \"It's a very busy week. There's a lot of stuff going on. It's tiring for me and I'm 28. At 86, he's doing OK, but I think his availability to get out and be on the course and be seen as much will be limited.\" Although age is catching up with his grandfather, Saunders revealed Palmer's eye for the game remains undiminished. \"It's amazing what he can still see and do,\" he said. \"Every now and then, the words of wisdom that come out are mind-boggling. There are very few people in golf who know the game, physically or mentally, better than him.\" The stature of this golfing great helps attract what are always strong fields at Bay Hill. McIlroy chose to play there for the first time last year, principally to honour Palmer's contribution to the game. The Northern Irishman returns again this week for what will be his last strokeplay outing before next month's Masters and is joined in Orlando by Jason Day, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson. Adam Scott is also in the field, bidding to become the first man to win three PGA Tour titles in a row since Woods collected five in succession in 2007/8. Two years ago, Australian Scott led for three rounds before a closing 76 handed victory to Matt Every. The American retained the title 12 months later, so again enjoyed a congratulatory handshake with the exalted host behind the home green. But no-one has been more successful there than the injured Woods, an eight-time champion who misses the tournament for the third year running. Woods may not be there but, like all the PGA Tour's events, it will still be screened nationwide and internationally. This, in large part, is Palmer's legacy. Not only did he make the game more popular but, in 1995, he also co-founded America's Golf Channel, which is currently available in 80 million US households. The ultimate beneficiaries of Palmer's legacy are the players themselves. This week, they will all make time for the grand old man of golf, and he will appreciate their gestures. \"All the guys coming to the tournament and seeing the familiar faces will definitely get his spirits up,\" said Saunders.

{"article": "Eight years ago, business guru Marianna Olszewski had a problem. The author of Live it, Love it, Earn it (A Woman's Guide to Financial Freedom) offers financial advice directed at American women. Some of her personal fortune had been invested using a secret offshore company. But in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, she decided she wanted to get her $1.8m back. The problem was that the bank that held the funds wouldn't release the cash without knowing who was behind the offshore company - and Ms Olszewski was desperate to keep her identity secret. Mossack Fonseca was willing to help. It offered to provide somebody who would pretend to be the real - or beneficial - owner of the cash. An email from a Mossack executive to Ms Olszewski in January 2009 explained how she could deceive the bank: \"We may use a natural person who will act as the beneficial owner\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and therefore his name will be disclosed to the bank. Since this is a very sensitive matter, fees are quite high.\" She replied: \"I do think we should go ahead with the natural person however I want to have your promise that you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 will handle this in the most sensitive manner.\" The \"natural person\" Mossack Fonseca offered turned out to be a 90-year-old British citizen. Mossack Fonseca told Ms Olszewski that the service would be expensive because it was so sensitive.  Fees were normally $30,000 (about \u00c2\u00a320,000 at the time) for the first year and $15,000 for every subsequent year. But she was offered a discount - just $10,000 for year one and $7,500 for every year after. One reason for the high cost is likely to have been the degree of deception. Another email from Mossack details what would be involved: \"We need to hire the Natural Person Nominee, pay him, make him sign lots of documents to cover us, make him sign resignations, make him get some proofs evidencing that he has the economic capacity to place such amount of moneys, letters of reference, proof of domicile, etc, etc.\" It's a blatant breach of anti-money laundering rules, but Ms Olszewski signed up anyway. Andrew Mitchell QC, one of the UK's leading experts on money laundering, has no doubt the bank would have been deceived. \"Anybody looking at all these documents will believe that it is entirely legitimately owned by this person,\" he said. \"Mossack Fonseca are prepared to go to that length in order to assist their client. Basically creating a real, live human being to look to the world as if they own the assets, when in fact and in truth, they know, as their client knows, that that person is a sham.\" The revelation that offshore companies are providing services of this nature could undermine the UK government's plan to create greater transparency. UK Prime Minister David Cameron has pinned his hopes for reform on a new register that will force British companies to reveal their beneficial owners. But the register won't work properly if companies like Mossack Fonseca pay people to pretend to be the beneficial owner. Marianna Olszewski failed to respond when Panorama attempted to contact her about this story by phone, email and letter. In a statement Mossack Fonseca said: \"Your allegations that we provide structures supposedly designed to hide the identity of the real owners, are completely unsupported and false. \"We do not provide beneficiary services to deceive banks. It is difficult, not to say impossible, not to provide banks with the identity of final beneficiaries and the origin of funds.\"", "question": "The Panamanian @placeholder firm Mossack Fonseca says it does everything possible to ensure the offshore companies it sets up are not used for illicit purposes .

{"article": "After a meeting in Rome with Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, Italian PM Matteo Renzi said his country would \"give Greece a hand\" without always agreeing with it. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis has reportedly suggested a new deal for exchanging debt with bailout creditors. The radical left Greek government was elected on a pledge to end austerity. The Syriza party, led by Mr Tsipras, won last Sunday's vote by promising to write off half the country's massive debt, sparking alarm on the markets and among eurozone officials. The Greek government also said it would refuse new loans from the EU and the IMF, prompting questions about how it would finance itself. This week, however, Greek leaders on a tour of European capitals sought to allay some of the concerns. According to the Financial Times newspaper, Mr Varoufakis has retreated from the idea of writing off debt, instead suggesting that it could be exchanged for bonds that would be repaid only if the Greek economy grew. The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has said the bloc will \"have to adapt a certain number of policies\" to accommodate Greece. Mr Tsipras meets Mr Juncker in Brussels on Tuesday. He will also travel to France to meet President Francois Hollande, whose government has also suggested a softer line on Greece. At the meeting with Mr Renzi in Rome on Tuesday, Mr Tsipras said Europe had to \"put social cohesion and growth before the policies of poverty and insecurity\". Mr Renzi echoed him, saying that the world was \"calling on Europe to invest in growth, not austerity\". However, he did not comment on the details of Greece's proposals. Despite the conciliatory remarks, many hurdles remain. \"Varoufakis is intelligent, but he is underestimating the problems,\" a eurozone official quoted by the Reuters news agency said. Greece still has a debt of \u20ac315bn - about 175% of GDP - despite some creditors writing down debts in a renegotiation in 2012. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has ruled out debt cancellation, saying creditors had already made concessions. This week, Mr Varoufakis said that he wanted a new plan for fiscal stimulus in place by the end of May, with repayment of existing debt tied to Greece's ability to restore growth. Mr Varoufakis added that he would negotiate separately with the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank but not with officials representing all three - the so-called \"troika\", which he described as a \"committee of technocrats\". The troika agreed a \u20ac240bn (\u00a3179bn; $270bn) bailout with the previous Greek government. Austerity measures imposed in an effort to manage the debt prompted outrage in Greece and led voters to reject the previous government. Instead, Greeks voted Syriza into power after an election campaign dominated by the party's message of change. In interviews in the German media published on Saturday, Mrs Merkel said she still wanted Greece to stay in the eurozone but did not \"envisage fresh debt cancellation\". Greece's current programme of loans ends on 28 February. A final bailout tranche of \u20ac7.2bn was still to be negotiated but the new government has already begun to roll back austerity measures.", "question": "Greece 's leaders have received a @placeholder welcome to their reported proposals for a debt deal , ahead of crunch talks with EU creditors .", "option_0": "welcoming", "option_1": "proposed", "option_2": "renewed", "option_3": "bid", "option_4": "guarded", "label": 4}
{"article": "The phrase \"Penny for Scotland\" is, of course, most commonly attached to the proposal by the SNP at the Holyrood elections in 1999 to reverse, for Scotland alone, a cut in income tax announced by the then Labour Chancellor. It was evinced by John Swinney - then and now the head SNP honcho on the topic of tax. Mr Swinney later dropped the plan, arguing that it had been overtaken because Labour had ended up increasing the level of tax paid by people in Scotland. Not, he stressed, because the SNP plan had annoyed voters. Mr Rennie undoubtedly has the Swinney plan in mind with his announcement today. Indeed, he is explicitly challenging the SNP to match his proposal - while stressing that it is different to the Nationalists' former scheme. The Scottish Lib Dem plan, understandably, derives rather from their own party's past. Previously, Paddy Ashdown proposed an increase in UK income tax of one per cent, to be hypothecated to fund education. The policy has also featured in past Scottish Lib Dem discussions. Now Mr Rennie has revived it, founded on a belief - disputed by some - that people in Scotland would be willing to pay more tax if it could be demonstrated that the product would be explicitly devoted to the public good. The Scottish Lib Dem leader says that his plan would raise \u00a3475m a year for Scottish education. However, given that schools education is delivered by local authorities, Mr Rennie is not in sole command of such matters - and would not be, even if he were to be elevated to Scottish government office. Despite that, he is adamant that his plan would raise cash for education. Firstly, he notes that substantial elements of the plan would be driven by the Scottish government - such as funding for colleges and the creation of a Pupil Premium, already in place in England, to channel funding to schools which need help to bolster pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Secondly, he argues that education is the dominant element of council spending - and that local authorities are crying out for cash to improve the system. He believes it would be sensibly spent. Another controversy arises. Would an added tax imposition in Scotland bolster or hinder the economy? Would it be fair and progressive? Crucially, Mr Rennie proposes levying the penny on all rates of income tax right now, from April. He wants to use the Calman powers which permit variation across all bands - without the capacity to differentiate between upper and lower. He will table a Scottish Budget amendment accordingly. Mr Swinney has ruled out such a move on the grounds that it is not \"progressive\", that it does not permit him to levy an extra charge on upper earners while protecting those on lower incomes. To which Mr Rennie says that one penny, generally, is a \"small price\" to pay. Further, he notes that those on top incomes will pay far more - and that the lowest earners are protected by measures introduced at a UK level, under Lib Dem prompting, to increase the salary starting point at which income tax kicks in. That means, he says, that no-one will pay more until they are earning \u00a319k or more, that someone on the median income will pay an extra \u00a32.90 a month and that almost half of the additional imposition will fall upon the richest 12%. If Mr Rennie fails to persuade Mr Swinney to incorporate the plan into his budget for implementation right away, the Lib Dems will include the plan in their manifesto for the May elections, with the proviso that they would then be able to revise it in the light of the new Smith Commission tax plans which allow differentiation across the bands. But it's still a tax increase. A tax increase to be paid in Scotland alone. However modulated, however targeted, it's an increase in taxation. Will voters in Scotland favour that? Right now? Will they vote for it in May? Mr Rennie is adamant that the Penny for Education plan was popular in the past - and will be again. Others incline to the view that people are often keen to see productive investment in education, the NHS or whatever - with the unstated proviso that the cost should fall elsewhere. The anecdotal presumption in some quarters is that some voters may be enthusiastic advocates of tax increases until they pick up their pencil in the voting booth. In which respect, this is a political calculation by the Liberal Democrats. Given their predicament post the UK General Election, they know they need to make an impact. An early impact. Hence the early announcement of this plan. They know they need to set themselves apart from their rivals. Hence Mr Rennie's challenge to his opponents today to state their views on his proposals. It adds yet again to the sense that this will be a different devolved election - one where tax is as prominent as spending.", "question": "Penny for Scotland , anyone ?

{"article": "Conceived as an epic tale of Shakespearean proportions, the sprawling series charting the highs and lows of Nicky, Geordie, Tosker and Mary transfixed millions of viewers in the mid 1990s. Ambitiously marrying the personal and the political, the programme would follow the Tynesiders from their heady teenage days to a middle age scarred by shattered dreams. But delayed by BBC reshuffles, legal worries and even the emergence of EastEnders, the programme's journey to the small screen was as tangled as the friendships it followed. With the weighty subjects of town hall sleaze, police corruption and slum housing as its backdrop, the nine-part series made household names of Christopher Eccleston, Daniel Craig, Gina McKee and Mark Strong. \"It chimed with my politics coming from a working class background,\" says Eccleston, who took on the role of idealistic Nicky - a student who drops out of university to lead the fight for change in his home city of Newcastle. Quickly seduced by the promises of smooth-talking politician Austin Donohue, he would devote his efforts to a battle against the establishment and spend decades dealing with the fallout of the rifts it caused. \"I heard stories in my own family about my Uncle Bill being sacked in the 30s, crying in a doorway and being too ashamed to go home, so all that stuff about the Jarrow Marchers resonated with me,\" he says. \"I knew it was epic, I knew we were doing something important. I felt it would have an impact because I knew my mam, dad and brothers would watch it and feel it very deeply. \"And if it was going to affect my family, it would affect families all over Britain.\" Raised on the likes of the BBC's hard-hitting Play For Today, Eccleston, who was part-way through shooting the film Shallow Grave, was alerted to the project by the film's director, Danny Boyle. \"Danny said he'd read some scripts called Our Friends in the North, which was a 'state of the nation' piece. I promptly went to a phone box - there were no mobiles - and rang my agent. \"The key scene for me as I read the script was Peter Vaughan's character, Felix, being savaged by one of those pitbull dogs that everybody started buying in the 80s and 90s. \"Felix comes to the door and tries politely to deal with some feral member of the underclass who then sets his dog on him. \"It just shattered me because I knew what [writer] Peter Flannery was saying - this idealistic man who had pleaded the case for the working classes was being brutalised by the failure of the system.\" While Eccleston had appeared in ITV crime drama Cracker and the British-made film Let Him Have It, McKee, Strong and Craig were still awaiting their big break. All that would change when Our Friends in the North was broadcast from January to March 1996. \"I had the highest profile, but how things have changed,\" Eccleston says with a laugh. \"Mark and Daniel are major movie stars and Gina's one of the greatest stage actors of her generation so there's a nice lesson in humility for me there. \"It doesn't surprise me. Daniel had a kind of rock star sexual charisma, which was perfect for Geordie, and Mark's an extraordinary character actor. Gina kept us all honest with the truthfulness and delicacy of her performance.\" While Mary and Tosker would soon rue a loveless marriage, Craig's Geordie Peacock would head for the bright lights of London to escape beatings from an alcoholic father. The addition of the future James Bond, though, came \"very late\", recalls Flannery, who is taking part in a question and answer session about the programme at the Whitley Bay Film Festival on Friday. \"We had almost cast a Geordie actor then the tape of Danny with an awful North East accent arrived,\" he says. \"He was undeniably magnetic. We thought we'd have loads of work to do on the voice, but the screen lit up when he appeared.\" Problems, however, were apparent from the outset of filming. Stuart Urban, one of the series' two directors, was asked to leave 10 weeks into shooting. \"I was devastated by it because it was bad,\" Jarrow-born Flannery admits. \"We were wrong to appoint him, we were rowing all the time on the set. \"I was poisoning it.\" Scheduled to helm the final four episodes, Simon Cellan Jones was enlisted to play a bigger role and the opener was reshot by Pedr James - with Flannery taking the opportunity to heavily amend the script. It was a move not without problems. \"There's an opening episode no-one has ever seen, although I've got a copy,\" Flannery says. \"One of the producers came up with the idea of writing a different story as long as it met up with episode two. \"The actors went mad. They said, 'How can you change our characters?' I think they were on episode five by that point.\" That things did not run smoothly when the cameras finally began to roll was perhaps not surprising as the adaptation had spent more than a decade in development hell. Flannery penned the story in 1981 while working as a writer-in-residence with the Royal Shakespeare Company. \"I thought don't write a two-hander. Write a big play they can put on - a chronicle of our times.\" Initially running from 1964 to 1979, the characters' journey concluded with Margaret Thatcher's rise to power, rather than the TV series which followed the characters up until 1995. First performed in 1982, it came to the attention of the BBC. Flannery's hopes of a hit on the small screen would soon be dashed, though. \"By the time I was delivering it in about 1984/85, it was now a BBC One project and the channel had a new controller, Michael Grade,\" he says. \"He was looking for a soap set in London's East End and that's what he got.\" There would be a further false start towards the end of the 1980s when BBC lawyers stepped in over concerns some of the characters were based too heavily on living real-life figures, such as disgraced Tyneside politician T Dan Smith. Flannery would finally resurrect the project as a nine-parter, but almost scuppered its chances in a year-long row with the BBC over varying the length of each chapter. \"It was a monumental struggle - long and painful - but I have no real regrets,\" he says from his Oxfordshire home. \"I created the characters for the stage when I was 28 and didn't finish writing them until I was 44. I couldn't have imagined what would have happened to them in their 40s because I was not that old. \"That was an extraordinary thing to happen.\" The series attracted weekly audiences of about six million - twice the number anticipated. Twenty years on, though, how does he view its legacy? \"There are probably six or 10 shows in the history of British TV that stand out and I think Our Friends in the North is one of them along with Cathy Come Home and Boys From The Blackstuff. \"It captured the zeitgeist.\" Andrew Collins, film editor at the Radio Times and writer of the Telly Addict blog, shares that view. \"Boys From The Blackstuff, which I agree is magnificent, is definitely a precursor in terms of what British television was still prepared to do. But Our Friends in the North is more ambitious, less of a time-capsule. \"By the time it became a TV drama, Thatcherism had run its course, albeit having reshaped Britain and not necessarily in a good way. Perhaps this was a better time to take stock and look back over 30 years to the optimism of the early 60s, which was now in some ways echoed in the early 90s Britpop movement. \"To end it with [the Oasis song] Don't Look Back in Anger was perfect, I think. You can't really fake that kind of kismet: the song was northern, working-class and looked both to the future and the past. And it's a great track. \"Such things matter with drama that wants to tell big stories and to resonate in the here and now. The personal becomes political, and vice versa, if you can pinpoint a dramatic way of bringing the two together.\" While its success \"opened doors\", Flannery believes budgetary concerns and an aversion to risk arguably make it more difficult now than ever for writers to translate their ideas to the screen in Britain. \"The odds are always stacked against ambitious drama,\" he says. \"One person leaves and you lose your champion. \"And these things are expensive. For a long time, if you weren't going to get a sale in America it was pointless asking for anything to get made. \"What I call 'panto dramas' like Doctor Who and Sherlock are massively entertaining and popular, but the broad church doesn't seem to be there anymore.

{"article": "Presenters Clare Balding, Victoria Derbyshire and Emily Maitlis are among those who have signed an open letter to director general Tony Hall. They urge him to \"correct\" the disparity over gender pay, which they say has been known \"for years\". Lord Hall said \"work is already well under way\" to resolve the pay gap. On Wednesday, the BBC revealed the salaries of stars earning more than \u00a3150,000. The salaries, published in the corporation's annual report, revealed two-thirds of its stars earning more than \u00a3150,000 are male, with Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans the top-paid on between \u00a32.2m and \u00a32.25m. Claudia Winkleman - whose name was not on the original letter - was the highest-paid female celebrity, earning between \u00a3450,000 and \u00a3500,000 last year. Education Secretary Justine Greening said the BBC's gender pay gap was \"hard to justify\", while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said discrepancies were \"astronomical\". More than 40 signatories include BBC Sport's Sue Barker, BBC Radio 4 Today programme journalists Mishal Husain and Sarah Montague, BBC News and Antiques Roadshow presenter Fiona Bruce and The One Show's Alex Jones. The report shows \"what many of us have suspected for many years... that women at the BBC are being paid less than men for the same work,\" the letter says. Pay disparities continue \"beyond the list\" of those earning more than \u00a3150,000, they add, including in areas of production, engineering, and regional and local media.

We all want to go on the record to call upon you to act now.\" The women say they are \"prepared to meet\" Lord Hall to ensure \"future generations of women do not face this kind of discrimination\". Woman's Hour presenter Jane Garvey - who organised the letter and is not on the list of top earners - told BBC Radio 4's BH programme the BBC should \"set a standard\" when it comes to fair pay. \"We are not after pay parity,\" she said, \"it is fairness that we are in pursuit of here, not enormous pay rises.\" \"I love what the BBC is meant to stand for - let's show the rest of Britain what this incredible institution can do.\" Clare Balding said she became concerned about the gender pay gap in 2010, when after presenting Woman's Hour she realised her pay for the show was \"40% lower\" than similar programmes. \"We are the high earners, that's why we are on the list, but don't tell me that isn't reflected all the way down [the BBC],\" she told the programme. \"It is right through and that's where I think we have got to stand up as the ones who are on the list and say 'hang on, enough, we can help you with this'.\" Education Secretary Ms Greening, who is also responsible for women and equalities, told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday it was \"impossible not to be shocked\" by the BBC gender pay gap. She said it was a \"reputational issue\" for the BBC, adding that it was \"very hard to justify\" some of the pay discrepancies. Labour leader Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he would be happy to sign the letter, saying the BBC \"needs to look at itself\".

Marr, who is paid between \u00a3400,000 and \u00a3449,999 a year by the BBC, said if he was a woman he would have been removed from the TV \"10 years ago\". \"There's a real lack of older women on the screen,\" the 57-year-old said. Responding to the letter, Lord Hall said there would be a \"wider consultation\" over the next two months to address the issue and that he would value the contributions of those who signed the letter. \"When figures are published next year I am confident they will look very different. \"When other organisations publish their gender pay data by next April, I want the BBC to be one of the best performers when comparisons are made. \"But beyond that, over the next three years I want the BBC to be regarded as an exemplar on gender and diversity.\"", "question": "Some of the BBC 's most high - profile female @placeholder have called on the corporation to \" act now \" to deal with the gender pay gap .", "option_0": "personalities", "option_1": "series", "option_2": "team", "option_3": "group", "option_4": "organisations", "label": 0}

Looking back, it was all worth it.\" Sinclair, now 28, joined Chelsea at 15 from Bristol Rovers and made a handful of appearances for the first team. In his five years contracted to the Stamford Bridge club he was loaned to Plymouth, Queens Park Rangers, Charlton, Crystal Palace, Birmingham and Wigan before signing for Swansea in August 2010. The English winger made more than 90 appearances for the Swans ahead of a switch to Manchester City, but was on the fringes there and was again loaned out, with spells at West Brom and Aston Villa. The pain of relegation with Villa, in his first season there after a transfer from City ahead of season 2015-16, has made the success of his debut season under Brendan Rodgers at Celtic all the more joyful.

{"article": "The move comes amid demands from one assembly member for a register of lobbyists in Wales. First Minister Carwyn Jones told AMs on Tuesday that ministers do not meet formally with lobbyists. But Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy said that appeared to be a change in stance from the Welsh Government. The first minister told AMs that the standards commissioner is undertaking work \"discussing with other UK Parliaments their arrangements and how they are working in practice\". The commissioner is due to report to the assembly standards committee, which requested the work, later this month. AMs on the committee are holding their own inquiry into the issue after Scotland and Westminster introduced new rules for the industry. Currently Wales does not have a register of lobbyists. Mr Elias is due to be replaced by Sir Roderick Evans in December. Lobbyists are people hired by a business, an organisation or a cause to advocate their case to legislators. Mr McEvoy has previously said that a register for lobbyists would shed light on who was lobbying for who, and for what. But an earlier report in 2013 suggested there had been no complaints about the practice in Wales. Mr McEvoy told Mr Jones during First Minister's Questions in the Senedd that a minister \"was pictured on Twitter attending an event with a commercial lobbyist\" and that on Wednesday the Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Children Carl Sargeant \"is a keynote speaker at a commercial lobbyist event\". \"Maybe you can explain to the public and this chamber the contradiction between what you say here, that they don't have access, and what actually is the reality, because we all know they do,\" he said. Mr Jones said: \"Ministers do speak at events that are organised by organisations, but ministers do not have formal meetings with lobbyists. \"If he is saying that no minister should ever meet, either formally or informally, with anybody who is remotely connected to a lobbying organisation, that's just impractical, given the size of Wales.\" \"But what we do not do is meet formally with lobbying companies if they seek meetings with ministers. Those meetings never happen on a formal basis.\" Mr Jones had said in July that commercial lobbyists do not have access to ministers. Mr McEvoy tweeted after the meeting that there was a \"seeming change of position from the government\". \"Now, it's formal meetings don't take place.

{"article": "But today the government's delayed Psychoactive Substances Act comes into force, introducing powers over what consumers can consume that are as radical and far-reaching as any such legislation ever. The intention is to solve the UK's problems with \"legal highs\" - chemical products not covered by existing legislation that are causing some health and social problems. Legal highs have been implicated in 76 deaths in the last 10 years (31 where they have been the sole cause), the Office for National Statistics said last month. However, that compares to 7,748 deaths involving illegal drugs, which has led some to question whether the government is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Nevertheless, the Home Office's answer to the threat is to make it a crime to manufacture or supply such things. It is clearly impractical to introduce separate bans for every new mind-altering drug that comes along (there are thousands being developed all the time), so the new law pretty much bans everything that can be called a psychoactive substance. It is, basically, a ban on getting high. The story of prohibition over the last 100 years is not a particularly happy one. Banning alcohol in the US in 1920 pushed the trade underground, with criminals selling bootleg booze of dubious or dangerous quality. Some 10,000 people died from drinking poisonous liquor before prohibition was lifted. Many argue the so-called \"War on Drugs\" has done the same: Simply handing the trade to unscrupulous international criminal gangs. Drug deaths in Britain are currently at record numbers. But with no governmental appetite in Britain for decriminalisation or legalisation of drugs, prohibition remains the only response the Home Office is prepared to consider. Ministers' first problem with prohibiting the trade in legal highs has been how to draft their ban so that cunning chemists cannot get round the law by tweaking the make-up of a substance to fall outside the latest list of illicit substances. That's why they ended up with a law that, with a few notable exceptions, bans the manufacture and distribution of everything that is \"capable of producing a psychoactive effect in a person who consumes it\". The notable exceptions include alcohol, nicotine and tobacco - not because they aren't dangerous and psychoactive, but because they are already so intertwined with our cultural and social lives. Foods like chocolate and beverages such as coffee and tea are also exempted for similar reasons. But the law seeks to prohibit the manufacture and sale of products with a \"psychoactive effect\" that may be far milder than a cappuccino or a Snickers bar. Basically, the government is determined to stop people using any substance that causes an alteration in their state of consciousness - unless it is a large gin and tonic or a fat Cuban cigar, of course. But banning almost anything that is \"capable of producing a psychoactive effect in a person who consumes it\" presented ministers with their next problem. How to prove that something does that? My report from Ireland last year alerted many in the UK to a central problem with the law as it had been proposed. The Irish government introduced a very similar blanket ban in 2010. The head shops were closed down but online suppliers moved in and use of new psychoactive substances in Ireland is now the highest in Europe. Police told me they were almost powerless to intervene because prosecutors could not prove in court that a substance was psychoactive. British ministers were questioned about my report and set about trying to prevent similar problems with the courts here. Finding an answer was not easy and the Act was delayed by more than a month while they worked on a solution. Now the Home Office has come up with an answer: in-vitro testing. Since you can't ask real human beings to take every dodgy looking product police seize to see if it has a psychoactive effect, the government has paid a commercial company to do a series of tests on existing legal highs in the lab (in-vitro). The aim is to identify a range of chemical structures that can be shown to bind with cell-based receptors and to which the body then responds. Having isolated a number of what are called Certified Drug Reference Standards (CDRSs), prosecutors will only have to get an expert witness to say that a product contains a known CDRS to prove to the courts that it is psychoactive. Well, that's the theory. But lawyers are already warning that this process has some tricky legal hurdles to clear. The most obvious problem is convincing a judge that something achieved in a test-tube by a private testing company, paid for by the Home Office, will definitely happen in the human body. For example, we know that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain and spinal cord from neurotoxins while allowing other molecules to pass through. It is far from clear whether in-vitro testing will be able to show whether the BBB will give a particular chemical passage into the central nervous system. The Home Office tests will not provide information on the potency of a specific compound, either. Indeed, the guidance says this is not possible or necessary, because the law does not differentiate between something that is 100% or 0.01% pure. This means that a product that has such low potency it causes no noticeable psychoactive effect can still be described in law as having a psychoactive effect and banned. Ministers are concerned that some legal highs don't act on the body by binding with receptors - but they want to ban those too. Substances like nitrous oxide and solvents cannot easily be subjected to in-vitro testing, so the guidance says prosecutions should be based on alternative sources of evidence including published literature and witness accounts of behaviour. Defence lawyers might well question whether a paper in a scientific journal and a witness saying the consumer looked a bit dopey is enough to get a conviction. Legal challenges are very likely in the early days of this act. But it may be that over time a body of case-law and accepted science will mean prosecutions act as an effective brake on dangerous new psychoactive products. The more troubling question, perhaps, is whether prohibition will once again hand the trade over to criminal gangs on the dark web, who are much more difficult to control than any High Street trader.", "question": "Conservatives are usually opposed to the \" nanny state \" @placeholder draconian new rules on business or banning things that experts think might damage your health .", "option_0": "slapping", "option_1": "organised", "option_2": "impose", "option_3": "lost", "option_4": "side", "label": 0}

Minutes earlier, Olympic champion Omar McLeod had given Jamaica its first gold medal of these championships as he powered to 110m hurdles gold. But it was the 1500m that had the capacity crowd on its feet, and while Muir's effort was brave, there will be debate about whether her tactics were the right ones for the occasion. After a first lap of 65 seconds she slowed it down to 71secs on the next, with Hassan and Simpson coming past her as she ceded control. At that stage Olympic 800m champion Semenya was way back, but the South African used her speed in the home straight as USA's Simpson once again timed her own effort to perfection as Dibaba went backwards. McLeod, 23, a sub-10 second runner over 100m flat, had held off Sergey Shubenkov by a tenth of a second in 13.04secs, with Hungary's Balazs Baji in bronze.

But with Poland's double Olympic champion Anita Wlodarczyk, responsible for the 13 biggest throws of all time, taking the most predictable gold of the championships with her fifth-round 77.90m, Hitchon's final round throw of 72.32m was her biggest of the night but enough only for seventh. The 26-year-old from Blackburn struggled to hold back the tears afterwards, her personal disappointment also bad news for a team that have already seen medal hopes Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Holly Bleasdale and Andy Pozzi miss out. \"I felt like I was in better shape and if I had the rhythm I had in qualification, you don't know what could have happened,\" said Hitchon. \"Of course I am [going to beat myself up about the result], that's part of my personality.\" Media playback is not supported on this device World and Olympic 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk set up his bid for double gold as he won his 200m heat, Danny Talbot running a new personal best with an identical time of 20.16secs in second. \"I think I'm in the best shape of my life, so I'm just trying to go with it,\" said Talbot. \"I'm very grateful to be in the position I am.\" Van Niekerk goes for 400m gold on Tuesday night, but the South African's great rival Isaac Makwala, the fastest man in the world this year, now has only the one-lap event in his sights after being struck down by food poisoning before his own 200m heat.

Conwy council had a \u00a3600,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant awarded to investigate the feasibility of restoring the pier. A group set up to help restore the pier said it will fight the demolition. The 113-year-old pier has been closed since 2008, and its condition has been deteriorating. The council signed a deal to purchase the pier in 2012, and was awarded a lottery grant in May to start restoration work. But it said that it would have to find more cash so that even planning of the restoration work could continue. On Thursday, councillors voted to begin the process of demolishing the pier which hosted performances from entertainers including Morecambe and Wise, Harry Secombe and musician Elvis Costello. In an emotive debate in the council chamber the pier was referred to as both an important part of Colwyn Bay's heritage and a \"white elephant\". Councillors were told that for the first phase of the project to go ahead, an extra \u00a3264,282 must be found, but the total cost of restoration was likely to be more than \u00a315m. Ronnie Hughes, the council's deputy leader said: \"Nobody is saying where the extra money is coming from. Sometimes its better to pull out and not to mislead people\" But councillor Bob Squire said there was \"a massive groundswell of public opinion to save the pier, which can't be ignored\". \"The pier is part of Colwyn Bay's heritage.

Councillors had six options to consider, including demolishing the pier, carrying on with the restoration, and restoring only the decking but not the pier pavilions. But they were told that all the options would cost money.  Officials said that even doing nothing would leave the council with an annual bill of \u00a353,000 to keep the pier safe, and other emergency works needed carrying out. Opponents say they will fight the demolition, firstly by opposing the pier losing its listed status. Gavin Davies, director of Shore Thing which was set up to help restore the pier, said: \"We should not give up on the pier.  It may be impossible, but we don't know that yet.  Local opinion supports restoration, and we need to do something. \"There are no grants for heritage destruction, and it may take years to de-list the pier.

{"article": "Nakhon Chompuchat, who is representing two Burmese men accused of the murder, said the victims' friends \"should know many things\" about what happened. The bodies of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were found on a beach in Koh Tao on 15 September. Suspects Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, are awaiting trial for the killings amid criticism of the police case. The migrant workers from Myanmar - sometimes known as Burma - could face the death penalty if found guilty. BBC south-east Asia correspondent Jonathan Head said prosecutors were ready to put the men on trial, two months after their arrest. Under Thai law suspects can be held for a maximum of 91 days before facing formal charges. Our correspondent said: \"Despite the claim by the Thai police that they have built a perfect case against the two Burmese defendants, the prosecutor has rejected the police dossier several times, saying it needed improving.\" Officers in the country have been accused of poor collection of evidence, reluctance to investigate influential families on Koh Tao and allegations they tortured the suspects to get confessions. Mr Chompuchat said he was appealing to any friends of Miss Witheridge, 23, from Hemsby or Mr Miller, 24, from Jersey, who may have information to come forward. \"Their friends should know many things about this to prove the true situation,\" he said. But the lawyer claimed witnesses were scared to come forward, adding that he had also requested information from a British police team which travelled to Thailand to observe the investigation, and from the British pathologists who examined the bodies after they were repatriated. Post-mortem examinations found Mr Miller died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge died from head wounds.

{"article": "His investment in terror imbued the collective Spanish psyche with a determination never again to undergo such civil conflict or to suffer another dictatorship. That remains the case to this day, exactly 40 years after his death. However, unlike Hitler's Germany or Mussolini's Italy, where external defeat led to denazification processes, there was no equivalent in Spain - and the shadow of his regime still bedevils politics. Franco's vengeful triumphalism had been fostered in the military academies, where officer cadets were trained to regard democracy as signifying disorder and regional separatism. As the dictatorship was rapidly dismantled, some of its senior military defenders did not share the massive political consensus in favour of democratisation and so endeavoured to turn back the clock at several moments in the late 1970s and, most dramatically, in the attempted coup of Colonel Antonio Tejero on 23 February 1981. After the defeat of the coup in 1981, the attitudes of the armed forces were changed by Spain's entry into Nato in 1982, which shifted their focus outwards from their previous obsession with the internal enemy. Scarred by the horrors of the civil war and the post-war repression, during the transition to democracy Spaniards rejected both political violence and Franco's idea that, by right of conquest, one half of the country could rule over the other. However, what was impossible in a democracy was a counter-brainwashing. Moreover, especially in his later years, Franco did not rule by repression alone: he enjoyed a considerable popular support. There were those who, for reasons of wealth, religious belief or ideological commitment, actively sympathised with his military rebels during the civil war. Then, from the late 1950s onwards, there was the support of those who were simply grateful for rising living standards. Although in the many national, regional and municipal elections that have been held in Spain since 1977, openly Francoist parties have never gained more than 2% of the vote, a residual acceptance of the values of the Franco dictatorship can be found in the ruling conservative Popular Party and its electorate. Accordingly, no government has ever declared the Franco regime to be illegitimate. It was not until 2007 that the Law of Historical Memory made tentative efforts to recognise the sufferings of the victims of Francoism. Equally slow has been the process of removing the symbols of the dictatorship, the Falangist equivalent of the swastika - its emblem of the yoke and arrows - on church walls, street names commemorating Franco's generals and, above all, the huge basilica and towering cross of the Valley of the Fallen where the dictator is buried. Call for removal of Franco's remains from Valley of Fallen UN presses Spain over Franco-era crimes and mass graves Fate of Franco's Valley of Fallen reopens Spain wounds Today, along with the still open wounds of the civil war and the repression, two other shadows of the dictatorship hang over Spain - corruption and regional division. The Caudillo's rigid centralism and its brutal application to the Basque Country and Catalonia had left more powerful nationalist movements there than had ever existed before 1936. The democratic constitution of 1978 enshrined rights of regional autonomy for Catalonia and the Basque Country with which the right has never been comfortable. Mass pressure in Catalonia for increased autonomy met with an intransigence that has fuelled a campaign for independence. Drawing on a residual Francoist centralism, the Popular Party has fomented hostility to Catalonia in particular for electoral gain. The consequent divisiveness, at times bordering on mutual hatred, is one of the most damaging legacies of Francoism. The other is the corruption that permeates all levels of Spanish politics. Needless to say, there was corruption before Franco and corruption is not confined to Spain. Nevertheless, it is true that the Caudillo used corruption both to reward and control his collaborators. Recent research has uncovered proof of how he used his power to enrich himself and his family.  In general, the idea that public service exists for private benefit is one of the principal legacies of his regime. It will thus be many years before Spain is free of Franco's legacy.

{"article": "US media say Mr Trump passed on classified information to Russian officials last week, but Mr Putin says this is not the case. He said he would release a record of the meeting to the US Congress if they requested it. The news comes amid reports Mr Trump tried to influence an investigation into his team's dealings with Russia. US media have quoted a memo by former FBI director James Comey that reportedly says Mr Trump asked him to drop an inquiry into links between his ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Moscow. The fallout from both issues continues to consume Washington, with moves by Democrats to launch an independent commission starting to gather momentum. As for Mr Trump, he told US Coast Guard Academy graduates in Connecticut: \"No politician in history has been treated worse or more unfairly.\" Mr Trump met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak at the White House last Wednesday. The meeting came amid an ongoing FBI inquiry and congressional hearings into possible Russian influence in the 2016 US election. It also came a day after Mr Trump dismissed Mr Comey from his post. On Monday, the Washington Post, followed by a number of other US outlets, said Mr Trump had given the Russian officials information relating to the Islamic State group (IS) that could have endangered the source of the information. The information was reportedly deemed so sensitive it had not been shared with key US partners, let alone Russia. Mr Trump later defended his right to share the information, and his national security adviser HR McMaster said the president's actions were \"wholly appropriate\". On Wednesday, Mr Putin joked that the meeting did not unfold as had been portrayed. \"I spoke to him [Lavrov] today,\" he said. \"I'll be forced to issue him with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us.\" While in charge at the FBI, Mr Comey was heading an investigation into possible Russian influence on the US election. The Russia story has already claimed one victim - Mr Trump's first national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was fired after misleading the government over his meetings with Mr Kislyak. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Mr Comey wrote a memo following a meeting with the president on 14 February, saying that Mr Trump had asked him to close an investigation into Mr Flynn's actions. He reportedly shared this memo with top FBI associates. \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,\" the president told Mr Comey, according to accounts of the memo. \"He is a good guy.\" Mr Comey did not respond to his request, according to this account, but replied: \"I agree he is a good guy.\" The FBI chief was later fired by Mr Trump. The official reason was over his handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while at the state department. But Mr Trump said in an interview last week that \"this Russian thing\" was on his mind as he made the decision. The White House denied the allegation that Mr Trump had tried to influence Mr Comey. \"The president has never asked Mr Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,\" it said. A White House official also pointed out that acting FBI director Andrew McCabe had testified last week that there had been \"no effort to impede our investigation to date\". The Senate's Intelligence Committee said it had asked Mr Comey to appear before the panel to testify, and had asked the FBI for all relevant documents, including the memo. House Oversight Committee chair Jason Chaffetz, a senior Republican, said the memo and related documents \"raise questions as to whether the president attempted to influence or impede the FBI's investigation\". On Wednesday, the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, said it was crucial to let investigations run their course before rushing to judgment. But Democratic members of the House of Representatives said they would try and force a vote to create an independent commission into the Russia ties. Two Republicans backed the move, they said. Adam Schiff, the highest-ranked Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said this intervention by Mr Trump, if confirmed, amounted to \"interference or obstruction of the investigation\". The key legal statute is 18 US Code Section 1512, which contains a broad definition allowing charges to be brought against someone who \"obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so\". It has been pointed out that Mr Trump did have the legal authority to fire Mr Comey, but there is a legal precedent for otherwise lawful acts to be considered an obstruction of justice if done with corrupt intentions, the New York Times says. Legal experts have told the Washington Post that that is not clear in this case as intent is difficult to prove. However, former federal prosecutor Samuel Buell told the Times: \"The evidence of improper purpose has gotten much stronger since the day of Comey's firing. \"Trump has made admissions about that. And we now have evidence that he may have indicated an improper purpose previously in his communications with Comey about the Russia investigation.\" The \"i\" word - impeachment - has already been broached. If this were a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, articles of impeachment would likely be in the drafting process. Republicans still call the shots in Congress, however, and it's a significant leap to get them to abandon the Trump presidency and any hope of advancing their agenda for the foreseeable future. For the rank-and-file to turn on the president will require them to admit their complicity in a failed presidency. You can't help feeling that the Kremlin is loving this. As the US administration - and the US superpower - staggers from one crisis to the next, Russia is watching and revelling in a political rival tearing itself apart. President Putin's comments today on America were full of sarcasm and patronising put-downs. He said he was ready to provide the US Congress with a transcript of Foreign Minister Lavrov's conversation with President Trump. But that was surely just another dig at America.

{"article": "The claim was made by the presidents of the Royal Society, the British Academy and the Academy of Medical Sciences. Sir Paul Nurse, Lord Stern and Sir John Tooke said scientific collaboration would be damaged by a \"Yes\" vote. The Scottish government said links would continue under independence, with plans for a common research area. In a joint letter to The Times newspaper, the three academics also claimed that maintaining existing levels of research in Scotland would cost Scottish taxpayers more should the country leave the UK. They wrote: \"Scotland has long done particularly well through its access to UK research funding. \"If it turns out that an independent Scotland has to form its own science and research budget, maintaining these levels of research spending would cost the Scottish taxpayer significantly more.\" They went on to state that the strong links and collaborations which exist across the UK \"would be put at risk\", with any new system aiming to restore these links \"likely to be expensive and bureaucratic\". The presidents wrote: \"We believe that if separation were to occur, research not only in Scotland but also the rest of the UK would suffer. \"However, research in Scotland would be more vulnerable and there could be significant reductions in range, capacity and critical mass.\" However Academics for Yes, a pro-independence group which comprises 60 academics from Scottish universities, said a \"Yes\" vote would protect the country's universities and allow research priorities to be determined. Its spokesman, Professor Bryan MacGregor from the University of Aberdeen, said: \"On the one hand, we have the UK and England contexts of cuts in research and science funding, high student fees with unsustainable loan funding, an immigration policy that is preventing and deterring international student recruitment and the possibility of an exit from the EU and its research funding. \"And, on the other, we have a Scottish government committed to funding research, to free access to universities for residents and to attracting international students. \"People may be unaware of the existing scope of international collaboration in the funding of research, not least between the UK and Ireland which have a number of agreements  through the research councils, as does the UK and several other countries. And other countries do likewise. \"The European Research Council allocates billions of Euros according to quality of the research, and there are international collaborations such as CERN. Scottish independence would not make any difference to such activities.\" Earlier this year a group of 14 clinical academics and scientists put their names to an open letter raising \"grave concerns that the country does not sleepwalk into a situation that jeopardises its present success in the highly-competitive arena of biomedical research\". But the Scottish government, which currently provides about a third of research funds, has argued there is no reason why the current UK-wide structure for funding could not continue post-independence. In a recent paper on the future of higher education research it argued that independence would give Scottish universities more opportunities for global collaboration and promotion. Responding to The Times letter, a Scottish government spokesman said: \"The Scottish government has already shown our commitment to research through increased investment since 2007 and we will continue to support research in an independent Scotland providing levels of public investment in university research which enable our universities to remain internationally competitive. \"With independence it will continue to be in the interest of both Scotland and the UK to collaborate as part of a single research area. \"Scotland currently contributes substantially to UK Research Councils' funding through its share of UK tax receipts and, with independence, we will negotiate with the UK government a fair funding formula for Scotland's contribution. \"We will also ensure there is no adverse funding impact from Scotland's transition to independence and, indeed, believe that independence will bring opportunities for increased research funding through wider collaborations with partners in Europe and beyond, facilitated by our greater presence and profile on the world stage.\"", "question": "Medical and scientific research across the UK would suffer if Scotland votes for independence , according to the @placeholder of three academic institutions .", "option_0": "consensus", "option_1": "size", "option_2": "heads", "option_3": "number", "option_4": "freedom", "label": 2}

{"article": "I have spent a lot of 2015 watching all these developments, in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Russia. The images of would-be migrants landing exhausted from boats or trudging along dusty roads in the hope of finding refuge and prosperity have tended to dominate our memories of this year. Yet not every refugee is fleeing persecution.  In the Libyan capital, Tripoli, I visited a prison for captured migrants. They were men in their twenties and thirties, mostly from West Africa and Pakistan, who had been trying to get to Europe for work. Alongside them were several people-smugglers whom the Libyans had captured. One I interviewed had been in charge of a boat which sank with the loss of 700 lives earlier in the year. Now he faced a long prison sentence. \"If you could see inside my heart,\" he said, \"you'd see the pain and sadness there.\" Maybe he even meant it. Much of my year was taken up with events in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the systems left by the Americans and British have been under increasing threat. In May, the capture by IS of the Iraqi city of Ramadi, 60 miles west of Baghdad, was deeply shocking, and demonstrated the savage effectiveness of the IS policy of butchering their prisoners: the Iraqi soldiers just ran for it. Baghdad itself still seems completely secure, but nervous. The new Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, an impressive and active-minded man, was optimistic when I interviewed him immediately after the fall of Ramadi. \"I assure you we'll get it back soon,\" he said. \"What are we talking about - months?\" \"No, no, I'm talking about days now.\" \"Days?\" \"Yes.\" Much of Ramadi has indeed been recaptured, with significant gains coming in recent days - but it is seven months since it fell. In Afghanistan I watched the advance of the Taliban in Helmand province and elsewhere. Yet I was struck again and again by the differences between the Taliban and IS, which is getting a foothold in Afghanistan. That has brought it into conflict with the Taliban, who have now sent some of their best fighters to combat them. A senior Taliban figure, Manam Niazi, told me in September he was confident that Taliban fighters who had gone over to IS would soon return. That hasn't yet happened either. In Libya the inability of the two rival governments, one in Tripoli and the other in Tobruk, to agree a coalition has also let IS in. There is as yet no sign that IS is taking the country over. But the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011 has opened the door to every form of instability. In July I watched the chaotic proceedings in Tripoli as nine of his followers were sentenced to death and others to long terms of imprisonment. Still, Tripoli itself remains quiet, though kidnappings for ransom are on the rise. Almost exactly a year ago I travelled to Moscow for President Putin's annual press conference.  It was a bravura affair lasting four hours, in which journalists could ask him anything, from his policies on Ukraine to how much he earns and who he is dating. I asked a question that I hoped might show which way Russia would be heading in 2015. It did. Would Mr Putin, I asked, take this opportunity to tell the West that he didn't want a new Cold War? Any Western leader would have used it as a chance to turn on the charm. Not so Vladimir Putin. \"Russia,\" he said sternly, \"has indeed contributed to the tension that we're seeing in the world, but only in the sense that it's protecting its national interests more and more robustly\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.  It's all about protecting our independence, our sovereignty, and our right to exist.\" Some of what has happened in 2015 was affected by Mr Putin's obsession with making Russia feel like a superpower again. It became clear that his takeover of Crimea in 2014 is now permanent.  I went back to Crimea in March, and found it was entirely quiet. Sergey Aksyonov, whose alleged gangland connections didn't prevent Russia from making him Crimea's prime minister, put it bluntly:  \"Crimea will never be part of Ukraine. The decision has been made once and for all.\" People there do indeed seem to have accepted the switch from Ukrainian to Russian ownership. International sanctions over Crimea are making life increasingly hard for ordinary Russians. But in 2015 Russia came back into the mainstream of international politics. In October I saw Vladimir Putin brilliantly take control of a summit in Paris between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine. It was supposed to be about Ukraine, but it became a platform for Mr Putin to line up with Western countries in attacking IS in Syria. It was a clever stroke - but will it help to destroy IS? In Iraq, in Syria, in Afghanistan, in Libya, IS has moved ahead this year. But in spite of the chaotic responses there, I suspect that a new and often mutually hostile coalition that includes the West, Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia will start to make inroads into IS's achievements in 2016.", "question": "This has been , above all , the year of the migrant .

{"article": "It said the failure meant such sites pose an unknown risk to the population. The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (Comare) investigated radium contamination at Dalgety Bay in Fife. Members said the Scottish government should consider building an offshore barrier on the affected coastline. The source of the radiation at Dalgety Bay is thought to be luminous instrument dials from aircraft which were buried in the area after the Second World War. The instrument dials on the aircraft had been illuminated by paint containing radium-226. The planes were stationed at the nearby HMS Merlin airfield, which was commissioned in 1939 as a Royal Naval Aircraft Repair Yard and decommissioned in 1959 before being sold off in the 1960s. In its report, Comare said contamination at the beach in Fife posed a potential risk to public health and could get worse unless action was taken. In addition to the option of an offshore barrier, the report recommended that children should not dig on the beach, additional warnings should be posted at the site and further research should be carried out into the effect of the contamination. The report said a lack of records of the amount of radioactive material brought onto the site meant that it was not possible \"to determine the radioactivity remaining or to estimate the longevity or magnitude of the associated hazard\". The committee said it was \"unlikely that there is a current significant risk posed by airborne contamination\" but that more work was needed to determine the risk posed by skin contact, particularly for young children. Representatives of the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa), Public Health England and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) have observer status at Comare meetings. An MoD spokesman said: \"The advice from Public Health England, formerly the Health Protection Agency, has consistently been and following consideration of this report, continues to be, that the risk to the local community at Dalgety Bay from the presence of radium is very low. \"The government is committed to ensuring that those living locally continue to receive the best possible advice which is why we have worked closely with COMARE to ensure the report's findings are based on the most comprehensive and up-to-date information available. \"Over the last two decades the MoD has worked closely with Sepa, the Scottish government and the Dalgety Bay Forum to manage the site so that the local community can continue to safely use the bay. \"A report setting out remediation options was published earlier this year and next month the MoD will publish a long term solution for the bay, setting out how all parties can best manage the site in the future.\" The Scottish government criticised the MoD for allegedly delaying publication of the report. Scotland's Public Health Minister, Michael Matheson, claimed the delay represented \"a lack of transparency on behalf of the MoD and suggests a disregard for the concerns of the local community at Dalgety Bay\". He added: \"The report confirms that it is very unlikely that there is a link between elevated rates of particular cancers at Dalgety Bay and the radioactive contamination. \"This is welcome, and I hope it offers some measure of reassurance to the community of Dalgety Bay. \"Nonetheless, the report does conclude that the contamination poses a public health risk, particularly through possible skin contact and ingestion. \"While the warning signs and access restrictions applied at the beach should minimise these risks, these measures cannot be permanent.\" He added: \"The report makes a number of important recommendations about managing this in the long term, including that effective remediation of the affected area is undertaken as soon as possible. \"Sepa have been working with the MoD on the development of remediation options, even while the report remained unpublished, and so I am expecting the MoD to start to implement a long term solution shortly.\"", "question": "It is unacceptable that the UK does not have comprehensive records of @placeholder potentially contaminated with radiation , a report has said .", "option_0": "products", "option_1": "land", "option_2": "gains", "option_3": "leaving", "option_4": "words", "label": 1}

At the Crucible, only Steve Davis, a six-time world champion, and Stephen Hendry, a seven-time winner, have more titles.

At other periods in the plateau's history, it was Tibet which exercised power and influence over its neighbours - including China. It would be hard to find any state in the world today that has not been subjected to foreign domination or influence at some era in its history. In Tibet's case the degree and duration of foreign influence and interference was relatively limited.\" \"Traditional Tibetan society - like most of its Asian contemporaries - was backward and badly in need of reforms. However, it is completely wrong to use the word \"feudal\" from the perspective of medieval Europe to describe traditional Tibetan society. Tibet before the invasion, in fact, was far more egalitarian than most Asian countries of that time. Hugh Richardson, who spent a total of nine years in Tibet as Britain's last and independent India's first representative, wrote: \"Even communist writers have had to admit there was no great difference between rich and poor in [pre-1949] Tibet.\" \"An internal Chinese military document states that from 1952 to 1958, the People's Liberation Army crushed 996 rebellions and killed over 10,000 Tibetans in the north-eastern region of Kanlho. Golog, another Amdo area, saw its population halved from an estimated 140,000 in 1956 to about 70,000 in 1964. Referring to this area, the late Panchen Lama [the second most important figure in Tibetan Buddhism after the Dalai Lama] told Beijing's leaders: \"If there was a film made on all the atrocities perpetrated in Qinghai Province, it would shock the viewers. In Golog area, many people were killed and their dead bodies rolled down the hill into a big ditch.

{"article": "These are people who have either engineered airline IT networks or actually worked on British Airways' systems in the past. What I've heard is a lot of confusion and scepticism at the idea that a local power surge could have wreaked such havoc. There is also confusion as to why back-up systems didn't do their job. Only the people in the room know exactly what happened, so these views are based on the information made public, and bucketfuls of IT experience, including at BA. One put it like this: \"BA has two data centres near Heathrow, about a kilometre apart, so how could a power surge affect both?\" Then there are all the fail-safes in place. The two data centres mirror each other I'm told, so when one collapses the other should take over. All the big installations have back-up power. If the mains fails, a  UPS (uninterruptable power supply) kicks in. It's basically a big battery that keeps things ticking over until the power comes back on, or a diesel generator is fired up. This UPS is meant to take the hit from any \"surge\", so the servers don't have to. All the big servers and large routers, I'm told, also have dual power supplies fed from different sources. I'm also told that, certainly a while ago, they used to have regular outages to confirm all the back-up bits were working. And daily inspections of the computer room. There is no reason to think these were stopped. It's not even clear who was monitoring the system at the crucial time. Was it a contractor? How much experience did they have? The point is this: certainly up until a while ago, British Airways' IT systems had a variety of safety nets in place to protect them from big dumps of uncontrolled power, and to get things back on their feet quickly if there was any problem. I'm assuming those safety nets are still there, so why did they fail? And did human error play a part in all this? British Airways chief executive Alex Cruz told me recently that the company has launched an exhaustive investigation into what went wrong, although no-one can say when it will report back, and whether the findings will ever be made public. If BA wants to repair its reputation, its owner IAG needs to convince the public that making hundreds of IT staff redundant last year did not leave them woefully short of experts who could have fixed the meltdown sooner.

{"article": "It is a subject which had attracted more questions than answers - hundreds were submitted to the BBC. On Monday the government released a 15-page document outlining some of the detail of their plans. BBC Reality Check has pored through the details and returned to your questions with some answers. Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK Government are committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements. The residents who have \"settled status\" will be treated the same way as UK nationals in terms of benefits, pension, social security and access to public services. But under the UK proposal, \"settled status\" would not give citizens the same family or legal rights they currently enjoy. For example, income tests would be applied for those who want to bring non-EU family members to the UK. And the European Court of Justice would no longer guarantee EU citizens' rights. The EU wants to preserve all these rights and this will be an important subject of the EU-UK Brexit talks. The UK document proposes that it should remain. If a child is born in the UK after a parent acquires settled status, the child would automatically become British. The lawyer advising us said: \"The following question relating to children of EU nationals and citizenship is difficult to answer as UK nationality law is a very complex area. \"The scenario in the question raises numerous further questions. To be able to advise definitively we would need to know when the child was born in the UK (before or after the parent acquired settled status in the UK) as a child born in the UK after a parent acquires settled status would automatically become British. \"Separate to this, the child may also have become British after 10 years of residence in the UK, which would negate the need for registering as British.\" Those with \"settled status\" will be provided with a residence document of some kind. Yes, he/she will still have to apply for the \"settled status\" but the government says it would make the application process \"as streamlined as possible for those who already hold such documents\". Yes, it will be lost, unless you have \"strong ties\" in the UK, the UK government paper says. They will also be allowed to stay. Those who arrived less than five years before a cut-off date will be able to apply for settled status once they reach the five-year total, providing that falls within the two-year grace period which will start after the cut-off date. The UK proposed 29 March 2017 as the earliest cut-off date and the day the UK exits the EU as the latest. Those who don't reach the five-year total within the grace period will be able to apply for a temporary residence permit. If you still haven't reached the five-year total after the end of the grace period, your situation will depend on the new rules, which are yet to be decided. Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then. The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This will be an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules, and the UK parliament would decide on the new law. You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that, but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations. Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.

The rebel coalition accuses Mr Bozize of failing to comply with the terms of a peace treaty signed in 2007. The CAR has had a series of rebellions and coups since independence in 1960. In the process, Chad has intervened several times in CAR, the BBC's West Africa correspondent Thomas Fessy reports. The nation helped Mr Bozize when he took power nine years ago and again in 2010, when he was fighting some of the rebel groups who are now on the offensive again. The Seleka rebel coalition - formed by breakaway factions of three former armed groups - accuses the president of not honouring a ceasefire deal pledging the release of political prisoners and payment for fighters who lay down their arms. The alliance has threatened to overthrow the government if Mr Bozize fails to enter discussions. About 20 vehicles of heavily armed Chad soldiers crossed into CAR on Tuesday to help stop the rebel advance taking place only 300km (185 miles) from the capital, Bangui, our correspondent says. The alliance now controls the towns of Ouadda, Sam Ouandja and Ndele, a major route linking the CAR to Sudan, Cameroon and Chad. On Tuesday morning, it also captured the diamond mining town and military base of Bria. Government troops tried to repel the attack launched at dawn, but were later forced to retreat.

Media playback is not supported on this device On a night low on quality but high on the sort of tension these relegation struggles provide, Sunderland missed chances - with striker Steven Fletcher the main culprit - to avoid the desperate closing phase that saw them survive a series of last-ditch penalty box scrambles. Goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon was a heroic figure as he produced a series of fine saves and handled with complete assurance in what must have been an excruciating last few minutes for the thousands of Sunderland fans who had travelled to north London. All the worries disappeared at the final whistle as Advocaat joined his joyous players on the pitch in front of their supporters, the veteran former Netherlands coach now a Wearside hero. And, with survival guaranteed, Sunderland's fans turned up the heat on their Tyneside rivals as they chanted: \"Are you watching Newcastle?\" The Magpies, who host West Ham, will fight it out with Hull City, who welcome Manchester United, to avoid relegation on Sunday's final day of the Premier League season. Sunderland and Advocaat must now decide whether to continue their successful relationship - but whatever happens he is assured of his place in Black Cats' folklore after taking them to safety. They only needed a draw to ensure Premier League survival and their first-half mindset reflected their objective as they dug deep defensively to frustrate Arsenal, with Gunners' manager Wenger an increasingly agitated figure. Jack Wilshere did penetrate the blue wall of defiance but Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud were unable to take advantage, both unable to hit the target from presentable positions. Advocaat made two changes for the start of the second half, sending on Fletcher and Jack Rodwell for Danny Graham and Connor Wickham. Media playback is not supported on this device The result was a more positive approach that brought three chances that should have been taken, two for Fletcher and one for Patrick van Aanholt, but Arsenal keeper David Ospina saved to keep the nerves of the travelling thousands from Wearside on edge. As the game became stretched, Arsenal had opportunities of their own and Pantilimon excelled with saves from Giroud's flick and an athletic stop to save Kieran Gibbs' header. Fletcher, however, was misfiring badly and was the villain again with two more misses that betrayed his lack of confidence. The Scot raced clear on to Defoe's flick but his over-elaborate attempted finish made life easy for Ospina, before the striker missed his clearest opportunity yet, scuffing over from six yards when Van Aanholt's mishit cross turned into a perfect pass. It must have been agonising for the watching Sunderland fans and they survived another scare when Jones, facing his own goal, headed Aaron Ramsey's cross against the bar.

O'Rourke called it \"the longest bi-national congressional live town hall in the history of the United States\".

It wasn't all high-level policy debates. The men sang along to Willie Nelson, The Clash and Buddy Holly, and made several stops for coffee, burritos and donuts. Votes in DC were scheduled for 630pm Wednesday night. The men left San Antonio at 7am on Tuesday and stopped in Nashville at 3am the next morning, after a day spent on the road and on camera. \"The last couple hours were tough,\" O'Rourke told the audience. \"You stuck with us, kept us company, suggested songs for the playlist, gave us some good questions.

While travelling, they received phone calls from current and former members of congress, including House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy, Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, Wisconsin Congresswoman Gwen Moore, and retired Majority leaders Bill Frist and Tom Daschle. The current elected officials who called in were asked to talk about a programme they were working on in Congress - and who they would choose as a bipartisan road-trip buddy. \"Joe Kennedy would be a good one - he'd have some good  Kennedy family history and is a great guy,\" said Republican Randy Webber. Though O'Rourke and Hurd both oppose President Trump's plan to build a wall along the Texas-Mexico border, they differ on several key issues. \"Beto likes to get the tank down close to E before we fill up,\" Hurd, who had a more conservative petrol policy, told viewers. O'Rourke also prefers to drive without stopping, while Hurd favours more pit stops. \"Will wanted to stop at every school house along the way,\" and engage the students, O'Rourke said, but school schedules and their tight timeline made such a request impossible. \"It would have been fun, man!\" Hurd insisted.

Bailey Gwynne, 16, died after being stabbed at the school in October. The accused, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, denies murder. Mr Strang told the High Court in Aberdeen that after the fight, the teenager had wiped blood off his hands with a tissue and given him a knuckleduster. He said he remembered the accused then used a mobile phone to call his parents. He said: \"I think he said that he had stabbed someone.\" He added: \"He said that he had been called fat and that he had retaliated that his mother was fat.\" The trial began on Tuesday, when the jury was told it was agreed by both prosecutors and defence lawyers that the accused became engaged in a fight with Bailey on 28 October 2015. They also agreed that the victim was struck with a knife and suffered a \"penetrating stab wound to the heart\". The jury heard earlier how an argument between Bailey and the accused had begun in a row over some biscuits which led to name-calling and then a fight between Bailey and the accused. Witnesses said they were not aware of any conflict between the two before the incident. A paramedic called to the scene told the court that Bailey was \"gasping for breath\" when he arrived. Gary Gillespie said the teenager was one of the palest people he had ever seen. The fast response paramedic said: \"He was gasping for breath with an obvious injury to the chest.\" He said it was clear there had been \"huge internal blood loss\". Mr Gillespie, 46, started treating Bailey, but his heart stopped. Efforts continued at school and then in the ambulance on the way to hospital, but there was no change in his condition. He said there was nothing more he could have done. Police officer Christopher Masson, who was called to the school, said the accused was handcuffed and then said: \"Is he dead? It was just a moment of anger.\" PC Masson added: \"He was very distressed.\" On the second day of the trial, the court also heard evidence from a friend of the accused. The witness, who cannot be identified, said he had seen the accused with a knife 20 or 25 times - including the Monday or Tuesday before the alleged murder. He told the court: \"I just said 'why did you bring it to school?' He was like he thought it was something cool to have. \"I said not to bring it to school.\" The witness said he had also seen the accused with knuckledusters 40 or 50 times, which the 16-year-old told him he had bought online. He told advocate depute Alex Prentice QC, prosecuting, that Bailey and the accused started fighting after exchanging insults. He said he was shocked as Bailey was \"really shy\" and was known not to fight back. Bailey was then stabbed and he saw blood. The witness said the knife the accused had shown him was a different one seen by the jury on Tuesday - a knife which had been recovered from a bin at the school by a police scene examiner after the stabbing. Defence counsel Ian Duguid QC asked the witness why the accused had items like knuckledusters if he was not an aggressive, violent individual.

{"article": "The Toffees willingly soaked up 71% of City possession but restricted Guardiola's side to few chances and scored with four of just six attempts at goal. Romelu Lukaku coolly side-footed in a Kevin Mirallas cut-back and the Belgium internationals combined again after the break, Mirallas drilling Lukaku's through-ball across the keeper. Tom Davies sent Goodison Park into raptures on just his second league start by dinking a third over Claudio Bravo and \u00a311m debutant Ademola Lookman fired between the legs of the keeper in injury time. Goals from the two teenagers left Everton boss Ronald Koeman visibly elated, while Guardiola cut a frustrated figure, remonstrating with the fourth official late on in what is his heaviest ever league defeat as a manager. City lacked cutting edge throughout, though had Davies not headed a looping Bacary Sagna header off the line before half-time, they may not have gone on to suffer a fifth league defeat of the season. They stay fifth, 10 points off leaders Chelsea, while Everton remain seventh. What a difference a week makes. After FA Cup defeat to Leicester last weekend an angry Koeman demanded the club's hierarchy \"opened its eyes\". The \u00a324m signing of Morgan Schneiderlin lifted some gloom but the roars for his 65th-minute appearance from the bench were dwarfed by the noise in injury time when Lookman, newly arrived from Charlton, made his mark. Koeman was bold in starting with Davies and 20-year-old defender Mason Holgate, but pragmatic in his game plan. City have had over 50% of the ball in every league outing this season but Everton sat and soaked up possession comfortably. Leighton Baines slid in to deny Raheem Sterling an opening early on and, Davies' header off the line apart, the home goal never looked under serious threat. The Toffees ran further and produced more sprints than the visitors, while with the ball they were direct, springing attacks through Lukaku, who proved a handful for City's ragged back four. Davies ran further than anyone on the pitch and released Mirallas in the build-up to the opening goal, before being involved in the second and cleverly chipping in the third after a driving run from his own half. Schneiderlin could threaten the 18-year-old's place but Koeman will welcome such a selection dilemma. The Dutchman knows his team are far from a finished article but this win showed all they could be. \"It looks like the title challenge is beyond City,\" BBC Radio 5 live pundit Kevin Kilbane said at the end of match where the visitors' soft centre was all too apparent and clinically exploited. After 10 games of the season Guardiola's side topped the table on 23 points, but 11 matches later he now says they are too far adrift. The warning signs were there in those opening 10 games, where City kept two only clean sheets. Their defensive predicament has continued and at Goodison Everton's direct balls repeatedly took the City midfield out of the game, exposing a back four which seemed to have little understanding as a unit. Vincent Kompany's persistent injuries have created a hole in the heart of defence that John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi have been unable to fill with authority, while in central midfield, Pablo Zabaleta's performance was robust but his quality on the ball is no substitute for the silky Ilkay Gundogan. Zabaleta had played 30 passes by the time he went off on the hour, 40 fewer than Yaya Toure. Individual mistakes also proved costly. Toure took a heavy touch for Everton's killer second goal, while Gael Clichy sloppily lost possession for the first. City have now conceded more goals than any other in the top seven, while goalkeeper Bravo has been beaten by 14 of the last 22 shots on target. Guardiola has answers to find.

The Ombudsman said this had caused Mr C's sister \"shock and distress\". The council and trust have apologised, paying out \u00a3650 for distress caused. The Ombudsman found \"a series of errors\" were made by the trust and the council, including the council's loss of an envelope containing documents relating to Mr C's financial affairs, letters between him and his family, and the key to his property. The envelope was found behind a cabinet at council premises after Mr C's sister, Mrs B, independently learned of her brother's death through his GP and contacted the trust. The Ombudsman concluded these oversights denied his family the chance to go to the funeral. Following the Ombudsman's investigation, the trust and council apologised to Mrs B and paid her \u00a3650 in recognition of the distress caused and for the loss of opportunity to attend her brother's funeral. She received a further \u00a3374 to cover the two months when bills were unnecessarily paid by his estate. Details of the case were made public as part of a wider report on complaints about the NHS.

{"article": "They drag the small boy into a minibus - he is shoeless and wearing torn shorts and a dark blue shirt that is at least three sizes too large. Ousseynou is one of an estimated 30,000 children who beg on the streets of the capital, Dakar. \"This is the emergency phase of our operation,\" says Niokhobaye Diouf, the national director of child protection. In the past, Senegal's authorities have been accused of complacency over tackling child begging. But in June the president ordered \"the immediate removal of all children from the street\". Since then more than 500 children have been \"extracted\" from the streets by a child protection unit. On the bus sit another 30 boys, aged between four and 13 years old, who are being taken to a shelter. Ousseynou will not stop crying, saying that his marabout, or spiritual guide, is waiting for him at a Koranic school on the outskirts of Dakar. It is common for Senegalese Koranic schools to send their students, known as \"talibe\", out to beg for food and money. Alioune Badara Seydi, Koranic teacher \"A child's place is not on the street, but how else can we provide for them?\" In the poor suburb of Sica Mbao, about 75 talibe beg for food and money every morning, from between 07:00 and 10:00. Koranic teacher Alioune Badara Seydi argues that poverty and lack of state support leave the schools with no other alternative. \"These children are sent to us by parents across the country who live in extreme poverty, but who want their children to learn the Koran,\" he says. \"A child's place is not on the street, but how else can we provide for them?\" He goes on to explain that the religious education they provide is valuable and begging teaches humility as well as reinforcing solidarity within a community. \"Many of the children that have been educated in this Daara [Koranic school] became important marabouts,\" he says. When most of Senegal's population lived in villages, begging seldom led to exploitation, and did not expose the children to the hardships of a big city's streets. In Dakar - which has a population of more than a million people - it is a different story. Children have reported being beaten if they fail to earn the sums demanded by marabouts, which can range from between 350 CFA ($0.50, \u00c2\u00a3.049) and 500 CFA. At least five children living in residential Koranic schools died in the first half of 2016 allegedly as a result of beatings meted out by their teachers or in traffic accidents while being forced to beg, according to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published in July. Dozens of other children have been severely beaten, chained and sexually abused or violently attacked while begging over the last 18 months, the report said. Although arrests of abusive teachers have increased slightly over the past year, courts in Senegal have prosecuted only a handful of cases and prosecutions for forced child begging are almost never pursued, HRW says. Activists say leaders have been worried about the potential political fall-out of such arrests. \"Politicians don't want to upset influential Muslim leaders,\" says Moussa Ndoye, who is in charge of a community project aiming to reduce child begging. \"I have yet to see any strong actions to support the president's recent declarations.\" But authorities argue the \"removal\" operations which started in June have already had an impact. \"This is the first time the police have ever forcibly removed children from the streets to protect them,\" says child protection director Mr Diouf. \"Already there are visibly less children begging in the city's business centre. We know some marabouts are returning to their villages\". But Mr Ndoye believes these measures are insufficient. \"It makes no sense to just pull children off the streets, no thought has been put into this action, there is no plan,\" he says. \"The action must be clearly mapped out and funded and involve the entire community. The state and the marabouts must speak to each other.\" Mr Diouf does concede that policing the streets in search of children will not be enough to end the practice. He says the authorities are in the process of registering all of the Koranic schools so they can be properly regulated. At the state-run shelter for rounded up children, Ousseynou is provided with clean clothes, medical care and food. The children's guardians, either their parents or their marabout, will be summoned to pick them up. They will be issued with a warning: If the same child is found on the streets again, they will face prosecution.", "question": "Four - year - old Ousseynou screams , struggles to breathe and uses all his strength to try to @placeholder the grip of the two plainclothes policemen who are part of a team cracking down on child beggars in Senegal .", "option_0": "reduce", "option_1": "protect", "option_2": "transform", "option_3": "identify", "option_4": "loosen", "label": 4}
{"article": "Adam Daly received fetoscoptic surgery in Germany that was funded by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. It is only the second time the surgery has been performed on an unborn child from Northern Ireland. Adam's parents Paula and Aidan, from County Antrim, said they are amazed by how he has reacted to the surgery. Speaking to the BBC at their Lisburn home, they said Adam has been able to move his legs. While the procedure is considered extremely risky, they are confident they gave their son the best start in life. \"I keep saying to him in our private moments that he is going to change the world,\" Mr Daly said. \"I just want him to grow up fit and healthy and have as many opportunities as any child would have. \"Whatever direction he wants to take, we'll be there to support him, and I am looking forward to be able to say to him later that at this age we did everything we could for him.\" Adam's condition emerged during the 20-week scan. Mrs Daly said the couple had no idea they would receive the news of their son's condition. \"When we went for the scan we were both thinking that the biggest decision was finding out about the gender and if we tell family and friends,\" she said. \"But the sonographer took her time looking and measuring things, and then I knew something wasn't quite right. \"The words spina bifida were familiar but I knew nothing about it.\" Spina bifida literally means split spine, and it manifests itself as a hole at the bottom of the baby's spine. That means the spinal cord does not form properly and may also be damaged. The central nervous system and spine develops between the 14th and 23rd day after conception. Spina bifida occurs when the neural tube fails to close correctly. The vertebrae also fail to close in complete rings around the affected portion of the spinal cord. The length of the lesion will determine the child's health complications, including mobility, fluid on the brain and bladder problems. Extreme cases can result in paralysis. The family said they are keen to tell their story as they want other couples to be aware they have a choice to have surgery before the baby is born. The procedure is only available in the United States and parts of Europe. Mrs Daly said the decision to go ahead with the three-hour operation was \"the biggest decision we have ever had to make\". \"The thought of having to do such a huge operation and in a different country with the risk of further complications travelling home was scary, especially as we have another child and we had to think of her,\" she added. The hole in the spine is sealed by keyhole surgery and the impact of the surgery is still visible after birth. Normally in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, the lesion at the base of the spine is closed by neurosurgeons after the baby is born. That means the baby is liable to have further health complications. On Tuesday, an international conference in Belfast will discuss the merits of fetoscopic surgery in babies diagnosed with spina bifida and the Daly family will tell their story to an audience at Queen's University. It is hoped that England will be added to the list of countries that are able to perform the surgery.", "question": "The parents of a baby with spina bifida have said they hope that @placeholder surgery he received while still in the womb will help him to walk .", "option_0": "sparked", "option_1": "pioneering", "option_2": "divides", "option_3": "threatening", "option_4": "produce", "label": 1}

{"article": "Special Report: The Technology of Business African start-ups make location pay Africa's journey to space takes off Business at the tip of Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fingers Using apps to mend our streets Victor Kawagga is a softly spoken young man, but his quiet manner can't counter the eager sparkle in his eyes and the passion he has for the machines he's surrounded by. The bedroom of this house in the Ugandan capital Kampala has been converted to a home lab, and the young people hard at work here are building robots. The 'him' he is referring to is Solomon King, the 29-year-old technologist and businessman who takes robotics into the classrooms of Uganda as the founder of Fundi Bots. \"He stalked me,\" laughs Mr King, bending his head slightly to fit his lanky frame into the doorway. Now Victor and 12 others spend their days at Mr King's home working on projects that involve using locally-sourced materials - in this case bike chains, spokes and the like - to build a robot that will move, sense water and light, and transmit signals to a receiver. Victor wants to go to university - but this is Uganda, and for ordinary people higher education is expensive. The government-funded scholarships don't always go where they should. Fundi Bots - fundi is Swahili for maker or artisan - is his chance to learn about a world that might otherwise have been denied him. The everyday applications of robotics might escape the casual observer but, Mr King says the science has clear and practical applications for life in Uganda. \"Fundibots for me is like a way to build a new breed of thinkers and innovators,\" he says. \"The thing about robotics is it's one discipline, but there's a million sub-disciplines in it. \"I keep telling the students that when they've finished their first robot, they've learnt about electronics, they learnt about logical thinking, they've learnt about programming, mechanics, you've learnt a bit about biology, you've learnt popular science.\" \"By the time you have a small army of people who have done robotics at some point in their lives, their mindset is no longer the same. They look at solutions from a creative angle.\" This certainly seems to be borne out by the young people in this room. \"Basically what I like to do is create something,\" says Arnold Ochola. \"For example we have a power problem here in Uganda. So if I can come up with something that solves that I would really be proud of myself.\" Betty Kituyi Mukhalu of Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Scientifique is the Fundi Bots coordinator, and remembers their first school visit: \"He came with this little robot, Nigel. Nigel walked, and it was so marvellous to see someone from our own environment having made that.\" Mr King says that growing up he was always 'tinkering', pulling things apart and putting them back together, or making something new. \"Back then most of us kids made our own toys, we'd make wire cars and all sorts of gadgets from old tins and bottles and stuff. \"I was always the one trying to make mine move on it's own as opposed to being pulled along by a string.\" Robotics is a 'solution waiting for a problem' says Mr King. \"Long term there's industrialisation which is maybe a bit too grand, but on the small scale we have small scale solutions - maybe a small windmill in a village that generates power. Maybe a home-made mosquito repellent system. That's what I'm trying to do with the kids. \"I think my biggest passion is to see Africans solving Africans problems. \"A lot of the time we get assistance from abroad and when you bring a solution down here it doesn't quite work, because it's different mindsets, different environment, just the weather conditions alone are strange. \"That's what Fundi Bots is about. It's called Fundi Bots but it's almost less about the robots than the process of building the robots.\" Technology is helping improve the prospects of students in other ways. Connectivity and bandwidth are on-going problems in most emerging markets, and Uganda is no different. Despite the gradual roll-out of fibre-optic cable, and the spread of 3G - and soon 4G - connections some areas can be patchy, and the cost of transferring large amounts of data is high. The Remote Areas Community Hotspots for Education and Learning (RACHEL) repository is a database of textbooks, online resources, MIT Open courseware and other sources. The content is housed in a server - a PC harddrive - and available offline. It is the creation of a non-profit organisation called World Possible, and in Uganda the content is distributed by their partners UConnect. \"We don't have one textbook per child here as you do in Europe,\" says UConnect's Daniel Stern. \"The teacher will have the textbook and the students will copy what the teacher puts on the blackboard, so to suddenly have access to an offline Wikipedia where everything is immediately clickable there's a very high level of engagement.\" UConnect supplies equipment - including solar-powered computer labs in rural areas - and the repository to schools, universities, hospitals, and prisons. But what if you don't have access to a classroom? Andrew Mwesigwa believes he has the answer. He is the founder of a virtual college - Universal Virtual Content - Uganda's first home-grown online-only course provider. \"People here like to be interactive, and go into a class and see a lecturer teaching and ask questions. \"I felt I should get a tool that would really be interactive so they get to feel as if they are in a real class.\" Training software from the US, and a digital pen that lets teachers share as they write while talking to students, has let him create an interactive experience that uses less bandwidth than video-conferencing. It's a simple solution but one that Mr Mwesigwa believes can work. \"Currently we are targeting mostly professionals around accounting courses, because they are quite popular and someone with accounting can easily get a job.\" The big problem has been convincing government agencies to accredit their courses. \"They're used to infrastructure, buildings, whereby you want to see a classroom, and that's what their forms require. When you say my school is purely virtual they don't understand.\" The ubiquitous mobile is being used help students prepare for the all-important Kenya Certificate of Primary Education - the KCPE. This determines the secondary school a child will go to, effectively dictating the path they're likely to take in life. A Nairobi start-up has created a service where pupils can subscribe to to take quizzes via their mobile phones. The questions are sent by text message. \"Initially our target customers were the kids who are isolated in the slum areas and can't get access to the internet and reading materials,\" says Chris Asego, MPrep's operations director. \"This is for families who are not doing too well and can't buy textbooks. That was our target market but as we grow we cover all bases, the rich, the poor, the middle class.\" The award-wining company is still fairly new - but according to Mr Asego growing. \"At the moment we have about 4000 users, and that's for a period of about three to four months so we're doing pretty well,\" he says. In Kampala, Fundi Bots is gaining supporters - they were recently the recipients of a Google Rise grant. The aim is for every school in Uganda to have a robotics club, where students can exercise their curiosity - and find problems waiting for solutions. For Mr King, this is the realisation of a dream. \"When I was young, I sort of made a vow to myself, if I ever grow old and if I ever have the money I would open up this huge facility for kids like me back then, where they could just walk in and say I want to build this, I want to do this, and everything they needed was there.\" He's nearly there.", "question": "\" I want to go deeper into machines - automatic machines .

{"article": "That's putting it mildly. Abigail Fisher's case against the University of Texas at Austin (UT) thrust her into the very centre of heated and overlapping public debates about race and identity, integration, privilege and education in the United States. Fisher brought the case because she wanted to stop the university from using race in the admissions process, arguing that as a white woman she had lost out on a place because preferential treatment was given to black and other minority students. But in June 2016 the Supreme Court decided to uphold UT's affirmative action practices and reject her complaint. Just a couple of weeks later and in her first interview with the national media, I have come to meet her for an early breakfast just outside Austin, Texas, where she lives. With the cicadas singing in the background and traffic jams already building as the morning rush hour gets under way, she says she doesn't regret her involvement. \"I saw that there was a wrong that was happening, and I had the means and the opportunity to lend my name to this case,\" she says. The University of Texas operates two admissions systems. The first grants automatic entry to the top 10% of the graduating class of every high school in the state, and accounts for about 80% of students admitted. Fisher did not make this cut. The second system, and the one Fisher was challenging, uses a range of factors, including race, to assess students for the final one-fifth of places. The university's vice president for diversity, Greg Vincent, says that because of residential racial segregation in Texas, affirmative action is needed to help the university promote \"both inter-group and intra-group diversity\". He argues that such diversity improves the learning experience for all students. Fisher says she accepts the value of diversity, but disagrees with how the university is seeking to achieve it. \"I would prefer to be in a classroom with people who have had different life experiences than me, and to learn about what they've encountered in their life thus far, and learn from that. And I don't think that's necessarily something that racial diversity will help. \"They can use any other socio-economic diversity, and take time to read people's essays and see that this person who has written this essay will offer a unique perspective on things.\" Vincent says the university has looked hard at the alternatives and that their current system is the only way of achieving their goals. He also points out that when Fisher applied to UT, 168 African-American and Latino students who had higher grades than her were denied access, while some white students with lower grades were admitted. This has been a key point in public discussion of the case. \"Becky with the bad grades\" is one of the more publishable epithets thrown her way by critics who just see a young woman suffering a bad case of white privilege. \"I try not to read any articles. I don't really care what people have to say about me in comments,\" she says. \"I'm proud of the grades that I made. I worked very hard for them.\" The day she received her rejection letter from UT, Fisher picked up the phone and called Edward Blum. A friend of her father's, Blum had spent years looking for a plaintiff to take on affirmative action. He brought this case and a couple of dozen others because he believes the courts, and particularly the Supreme Court, is the best place to achieve policy victories. Fisher knew from the start that she wouldn't personally benefit from the case. \"It was going to take longer than the duration of my going to college. It's not like they were going to hand me admission, and that's not really what I wanted.\" So in the meantime, she got on with her life, attending Louisiana State University while the case played out in lower courts. \"My dad would call every now and again and go, 'Oh hey, we went to the district court today', or, 'Oh, we're going to New Orleans this week to hear your case',\" she says. But eventually she got a call to say the case was headed to the Supreme Court. \"I was like, 'Okay, I guess I should brush up on the facts'.\" In person, Fisher is quiet and unassuming, and when she returned to her finance job the day after the hearing, having told no one where she was going, her colleagues were amazed that she had been all over the news. She, and many observers, were surprised that the case didn't break in her favour.  For years, including at an earlier stage in her case, Justice Anthony Kennedy had been stressing the theme of race neutrality, but this time he cast the decisive vote in favour of affirmative action. Listen to more Court in the Centre: How the US Supreme Court has become the busiest and most powerful institution in American politics BBC World Service, 30 July, 2300 Eastern, and on iPlayer Fisher points the finger at another judge, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who reportedly - minded to rule in Fisher's favour in 2013 - to instead send it for reconsideration by a lower court. \"It's interesting that these justices are easily swayed,\" Fisher says. \"What it should come down to is that they read the case, make an informed decision, use the constitution as a guiding document, but that's not always how it goes.\" After eight years living with the case, and all the downsides, she had hoped for a different outcome. \"It was really disappointing, honestly, but it's a long battle and if this case doesn't end affirmative action then another case will.\" But the chance that another case will come before the Supreme Court anytime soon is slim, in part because her advocate, Blum, is rethinking his strategy. More on the Supreme Court \"The most important thing an advocacy group like mine must consider is the old Hippocratic Oath: do no harm,\" he says.  \"Don't bring a case if you think that case could actually make the law worse than it is.\" Though he will keep bringing cases to local and state courts - where he thinks the justices are more likely to be on his side - he has abandoned, for now, his plans to take his fight against affirmative action in front of the Supreme Court. \"There are times in which you are wise to walk away from that fight, and perhaps at this point it might be wise to walk away from the fight about the permissibility about using race and ethnicity in university admissions.\" For a man who has been such a driving force behind the legal battle over affirmative action, that acknowledgement is hugely significant. But it undoubtedly raises the stakes for this year's presidential election, too. Republicans in the US Senate are refusing to consider President Barack Obama's nominee for the current vacancy on the court until after the election. With one or two more vacancies expected in the next president's four year term, whoever gets to nominate those justices could significantly shape the future of the court. Back in sweltering Texas, breakfast is over. Fisher will likely keep an eye on those Supreme Court appointments. She wants the public to learn more about the court, and she believes another case will come along which will overturn affirmative action. It has been, she says, \"really cool to be a part of it,\" but for now she will step back from the battle, and focus on her career.", "question": "\" I 'm a plaintiff in a pretty interesting Supreme Court case that 's been to the Supreme Court twice , \" says the young woman sitting across the table from me , @placeholder herself for the tape as I adjust the levels on my recorder .", "option_0": "introducing", "option_1": "arrives", "option_2": "preparing", "option_3": "pushing", "option_4": "shared", "label": 0}

{"article": "The trust opposed the development because of its proximity to the Unesco world heritage site. It brought a judicial review after Environment Minister Alex Attwood granted planning permission. Developers have said that work will now start as soon as possible on the resort at Runkerry. Dr Alistair Hanna, who has been driving the proposals, said it would be one of the \"most  spectacular golf developments ever seen in Ireland\". \"Not only will the resort provide a world-class golf links course and facilities attracting thousands of visitors each year, it will also protect the vulnerable topography of the coastal area which has been left vulnerable following decades of neglect,\" he said. Mr Attwood approved the plan to build the complex in February 2012. The development, on a 365-acre site, is to be known as Bushmills Dunes Golf Resort and Spa. The plan includes an 18-hole golf course, a five-star 120-bedroom hotel and 70 golf lodges. Last year, it was reported that the project could create up to 360 new jobs. However, the trust had argued that the minister should have consulted Unesco before making his decision as it could affect the Causeway's status as a world heritage site. During the judicial review hearing last month, a lawyer for the trust claimed the minister had been improperly advised. On Wednesday, Mr Justice Weatherup rejected all grounds of challenge to Mr Attwood's decision. He backed a counter submission by the Department of the Environment that world heritage convention guidelines have no standing in UK law. \"The court must step away from seeking to implement, directly or indirectly, what obligations there may or may not be under the convention. \"I must not grant to citizens of the state a right that only exists in international law, if it exists at all.\" However, he added that there were \"a multitude of reasons why the National Trust was warranted in bringing this application and I'm minded not to make any order for costs\". Mr Attwood welcomed the judgement and said \"the economic benefits of tourism in the north potentially knows no bounds\". \"My decision to grant permission was finely balanced but I was strong in my opinion that it was the right decision on the planning merits. This has now been endorsed by the courts,\" he said. In a statement the National Trust said it was \"bitterly disappointed\" at the decision and that it was convinced the development was wrong. \"We still believe that if a development of this scale does go ahead in this location, the message is that nowhere in Northern Ireland, no matter how important or protected, is safe from development,\" it said. \"The ruling today has served to highlight aspects of very serious concern for those partners involved in the care and protection of the world heritage site.\" The North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley, said it was right that the development goes ahead and that the trust knew they had \"no case\". \"Their actions I still believe have been disgraceful and damaging for the Northern Ireland economy, but we must take heart in today's decision and look to move forward as the course progresses,\" he said. Among those who said the hotel should be built was golfer Darren Clarke. He said that he \"didn't get how\" the plans would damage the area when they were further away than a hotel and car park adjacent to the site which is owned by the Trust itself.

The Unite union said schools, libraries and street cleaning would be cut and Unison said the 2% social care precept would not cover costs.

Unison spokesman David Lloyd said residential care providers' costs had risen and the living wage would also see expenses rise. Referring to the social care precept, he said: \"Even with the increase it's going to be difficult to make ends meet.\" Eric Segal, branch secretary of Unite, which organised the protest, said: \"These budget cuts, driven by a Tory government, will have an adverse affect on much-needed essential services such as schools and libraries.\" He said about 80 people protested outside County Hall in Maidstone, including union members, families, students, care home staff and library workers. Parents and pupils also protested against the planned closure of Pent Valley School, which KCC has said should shut because of declining numbers.

Alan Hill was on red watch at Highgate fire station when they received the call after the first bomb went off at the Mulberry Bush pub. Many Brummies lived in fear following numerous IRA bomb threats and tensions were high. He knew it was likely to be for real this time around. As the fire engine approached Corporation Street the second bomb went off. \"There were people all over the floor,\" he said. \"No movement. It was in darkness. All the shop fronts had disappeared. \"The explosion had taken the far side of the Rotunda windows. I sent a message saying there had been a large explosion, I gave up counting when I got to about 150 or 160 casualties. \"We asked for 40 ambulances, knowing full well that fire control hadn't got them.

Terrible pain and panic.\" Pat Bentley (pictured top left) was due to go out with her friend Jane Davis on the night of the bombings but after an emotional day during which she broke up with a boyfriend, she decided to give it a miss. A chance to have a laugh over holiday photos in the Tavern in the Town was instead replaced with a night in front of the TV for the 17-year-old, while her friend went out. \"We were watching TV and the phone rang and it was a lad saying \"Oh you're at home.\" He asked if Jane was with me and then told me some bombs had gone off in town. \"He drove over to my house and picked Jane's dad up, Arthur, on the way. We were wondering whether we should drive into town to find her. \"We couldn't just sit there and do nothing.\" Jane was among those killed in the explosion. Forty years on, Ms Bentley says she still cannot make sense of what happened. \"It makes me feel sad that you could take a life, let alone 21. I could've been in the pub that night but I wasn't. Who can say? \"I do and don't feel guilty. I should've been there with my friend but you just can't say what would've been.\" Maureen Mitchell, 21, worked as an assistant at an advertising firm in Birmingham city centre.

The issue is one of the major stumbling blocks in the ongoing negotiations to restore power-sharing at Stormont. It has been getting a lot of media attention recently after Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which opposes same-sex marriage, entered into a deal with UK Prime Minister Theresa May after she failed to get a majority at Westminster in the general election. The DUP rejects accusations it is homophobic, insisting it is instead protecting the \"traditional\" definition of marriage. A number of celebrities, including actor and writer Stephen Fry and singer Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy, shared their views with Amnesty International, one of the leading members of the Love Equality coalition organising the march in Belfast on Saturday 1 July. Ballymena-born actor Liam Neeson said: \"We've had enough of a history in our society in Northern Ireland of discrimination, mistrust and hatred. \"Yet, we're also an open-hearted, welcoming and terrific people. Let us show that to the world by treating gay, lesbian and transgender peoples as our brothers and sisters and allowing them to marry, if they so wish.\" TV presenter Norton said the historic referendum that approved same-sex marriage in the Irish Republic was a \"proud gay day\". \"My own mother was from Northern Ireland, so of course I have a huge affection for the place and its people,\" he said. \"I know it is hugely frustrating for gay people there that it is the last part of these islands still without marriage equality. Especially when there is such overwhelming support for it among the public.\" County Down-born singer Lightbody added: \"Two years ago, I marched with 20,000 fellow Northern Ireland citizens for marriage equality. It was a beautiful day of hope, joy and solidarity and I was so proud to be from 'Norn Iron'. \"Two years on and somehow - defying reason given it's the will of the people - we still do not have marriage equality in Northern Ireland.\" Coleraine-born actress Waugh, who will host the parade rally at Belfast City Hall, said: \"With the spotlight on Northern Ireland at the minute, now is our chance to really step up our campaigning a gear and give Northern Ireland what it so clearly wants and deserves, finally - equal marriage.\"", "question": "Liam Neeson and Graham Norton have called for the introduction of same - sex marriage in Northern Ireland ahead of a @placeholder protest in Belfast .", "option_0": "major", "option_1": "planned", "option_2": "disabled", "option_3": "coal", "option_4": "group", "label": 1}

Greater Manchester Police has released figures that show the force received 959 complaints about crime on social media in 2014, including sexual offences, threats to kill and harassment.

{"article": "\"I can play one team on Tuesday and one on Saturday,\" Zenga told BBC WM. Since Zenga replaced Kenny Jackett on 30 July, seven days before the start of the new league season, Wolves' new Chinese owners have invested heavily. \"It's a long, competitive season. It is not just the seven games we have coming up in the space of 22 days,\" he added. \"It is also the games we have after that. From now to January it could be 25, 26 or 27. We need to be organised in the right way. \"To play with the same XI, then I do not need to have 23 players. But in the long term, playing with the same XI can bring problems. It depends on injuries and international calls. \"My philosophy is to involve everyone in the squad. It keeps everyone fresh with a new mentality,\" added Zenga ahead of Saturday's home game against Burton. \"If a coach makes a lot of changes and he wins the game, then it is the right call. If the result is not good, then he gets asked 'why didn't he play the same team?'\" Former Italy goalkeeper Zenga has taken charge of seven games, in which Wolves have eight points from five league outings and progressed to the third round of the EFL Cup. Wolves made two summer signings prior to Fosun's takeover and the departure of Jackett - goalkeeper Andy Lonergan and Portuguese winger Helder Costa. Defender Silvio, midfielder Joao Teixeira and Iceland striker Jon Dadi-Bodvarsson also arrived before the season started. Seven more signed on at Molineux before the end of the transfer window, starting with Congo midfielder Prince Oniangue, followed by Manchester United defender Cameron Borthwick-Jackson and Benfica forward Ola John on season-long loan deals. Dutch striker Paul Gladon's arrival from Heracles preceded Wolves' first defeat at Huddersfield, while the club confirmed deals for Morocco midfielder Romain Saiss, Monaco winger Ivan Cavaleiro and ex-Wanderers defender Richard Stearman shortly before the deadline on 31 August. If nothing else, Wolves' burst of spending under their new owners has given most supporters much more optimism than they've had for the last 12 months. The very large crowd anticipated for Saturday's home game against Burton is further evidence of that. In terms of numbers, at least, they have made up for time lost when the squad became too thin to challenge last season. How much value they will get for their money will not be clear for some time. If things go well, Wolves could have a midfield full of continental flair, but it will be a challenge to get the best out of those players in the gruelling Championship once the days grow short. The return of a more familiar face in Richard Stearman may turn out to be as valuable as any of the other signings. Some were slow to appreciate him in his first spell at Wolves, but by the time of his departure he was deservedly held in high regard by supporters.

Real Lives Reunited revisits poignant moments in local history and brings together people who shared this common bond. In the first of six episodes, Fry speaks via videolink with some of the organisers of the West Belfast Film Festival, who gathered in the same cinema that hosted the premiere of the movie that told the story of Irish writer Oscar Wilde. Fry tells the programme that the team behind the film decided that west Belfast was a good place for the film's debut. \"We wanted to have a UK opening that also recognised the Irishness of Oscar,\" he says. \"I thought that Oscar was a unifying figure enough because he could be regarded as British to some extent and he could certainly be regarded as Irish.\" He adds: \"I didn't realise that the festival's major film venue was right at the end of the Falls Road, in the Kennedy Centre. \"For a sad little Brit like me, the Falls Road was only ever something that you heard on the news.\" Organiser Michele Devlin says that securing the film for the fledgling festival's gala opening was a big coup for them. \"At the time we only had a few thousand pounds in the bank, and everything was running on goodwill,\" she says. \"We had brass necks and thought 'we can do this'.\" Danny Morrison of the festival says they remained nervous right up until the last minute. \"Even though an agent or the person themselves says they're coming, there is always nervousness right up until you see them in the flesh, but he was good to his word - he came, he saw, he gave his time and he conquered,\" he says.

On 20 May, Exxon Mobil announced \"a significant oil discovery\" in the disputed area. A week later, President Maduro issued a presidential decree claiming sovereignty of the disputed waters. Guyana's newly elected President, David Granger, in turn released a statement on Sunday calling Venezuela's decree a \"flagrant violation of international law\". He also accused Venezuela of wishing \"to trample on the rights of a smaller country in order to obstruct the sovereign right of Guyana to develop its natural resources\". President Granger insisted that Guyana would continue to develop the offshore natural resources it considered its own. On Tuesday, the Venezuelan leader blamed Exxon Mobil for the diplomatic row. He advised Guyana \"not to take bad advice from Exxon Mobil or from (local officials) bribed by Exxon Mobil\". Speaking on state television, he said that \"with dialogue and diplomacy we should be able to iron our these historical differences\".

In his speech, he said he was delighted the \"last five long years are over\" and that there was a \"new dawn\" in East Belfast. He added: \"When people of East Belfast were asked to vote for a shared future, they chose to share that future with somebody they can trust, rather than back a party that are only interested in offering us a future if we share their view\".

{"article": "Gwede Mantashe made the comments after deputy Finance Minister Mcebesi Jonas alleged the Gupta family had offered him a government promotion. During a rowdy parliamentary session, Mr Zuma denied the family had influenced cabinet appointments. The opposition called on him resign. Mr Mantashe is the third most powerful person in the governing African National Congress (ANC), and his remarks suggest Mr Zuma may be losing the confidence of influential members of the party as well, correspondents say. Mr Zuma's presidency has been marred by allegations of corruption, cronyism and incompetence, amid a worsening economic situation. The crisis deepened on Wednesday, when Mr Jonas said that a member of the Gupta family had made \"a mockery of our hard-earned democracy\" by offering to promote him to the minister's job last year. The family also denied the allegation. In an interview with Bloomberg, Mr Mantashe, the ANC secretary-general, said: \"We need to deal with this; it will degenerate into a mafia state if this goes on.\" He told the BBC that Mr Zuma was not \"untouchable\", but denied that the party planned to oust him. The ANC would, however, deal with the \"corporate capture\" of government, Mr Mantashe said. Questioned by the opposition in parliament about Mr Jonas' allegation, Mr Zuma said: \"I'm in charge of the government. There is no minister who was ever appointed by the Guptas.\" The speaker ordered opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane to leave the chamber for breaching parliamentary rules, prompting the party's MPs to walk out in solidarity with him. Earlier, Mr Maimane said power had shifted from the government to the Guptas. \"You and your family are getting richer while South Africans are getting poorer,\" he told Mr Zuma. The party said in a statement that Mr Zuma's position was becoming \"increasingly untenable\", and he should resign or be sacked by the governing party. The left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party boycotted the parliamentary session, saying it did not recognise Mr Zuma as leader of South Africa. Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News, Johannesburg President Zuma's simple denial of his toxic relationship with the Gupta family seemed to sum up the view held by many here, that he is not fully engaged in running the country. \"Deny, deny, deny\" is the same strategy the 73-year-old employed when he came under fire over the use of government money to upgrade his private home in the rural area of Nkandla - until he was forced to make a U-turn when the opposition took him to South Africa's highest court. The court is yet to make a ruling on whether he breached his oath of office by failing to repay the money, despite an anti-corruption watchdog finding that he had \"unduly benefited\" from the renovations. In parliament, Mr Zuma seemed detached from the crisis gripping South Africa. Nor did the speaker, a senior member of the governing party, inspire confidence in South Africa's 22-year-old democracy when she threw out opposition leader Mmusi Maimane, as he challenged the president. The opposition has long accused Mr Zuma of letting the Guptas wield excessive influence. The Guptas, who arrived in South Africa from India in 1993, have huge interests in computers, air travel, energy, and technology. They said Mr Jonas' statement was political point-scoring. In 2013, there was an outcry after a private jet carrying guests to the wedding of a Gupta family member was allowed to land at a South African military air force base in Pretoria.

It said it believed AO.com and Currys may have broken advertising rules in relation to \"numerous\" examples of offers that appeared to inflate the \"was\" price to make savings appear higher than they were.

{"article": "Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party and Alexander Van der Bellen are each on 50%, according to the estimate, which includes postal votes not yet counted. Official figures from Sunday's ballot give Mr Hofer a lead of 3.8% but do not include postal voting. The final official results will not be known until Monday. For the first time since World War Two, both the main centrist parties were knocked out in the first round. A key issue in the campaign was Europe's migrant crisis, which has seen asylum-seeker numbers soar. About 90,000 people claimed asylum in Austria last year, equivalent to about 1% of the Austrian population, and the Freedom Party ran an anti-immigration campaign. The presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but a victory for Mr Hofer could be the springboard for Freedom Party success in the next parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2018. The presidents of the European Commission and the European Parliament, Jean-Claude Juncker and Martin Schulz, have both expressed concern over a Hofer victory. Austria is split. The soft-spoken, charismatic Mr Hofer, sometimes described as a wolf in sheep's clothing, caused turmoil in Austrian politics when he won a clear victory in the first round of voting in April. But now his rival, Mr Van der Bellen from the Greens, has caught up. The far right has profited from deep frustration with the established parties of the centre left and the centre right in Austria. And in recent months, it has been boosted further by fears about the migrant crisis. If Mr Hofer wins, it could have an impact far beyond Austria's borders - possibly giving momentum to far-right and Eurosceptic parties in other EU countries. Is Europe lurching to the far right? Europe's nationalist surge, country by country According to the interior ministry's final count of votes cast at polling-stations (in German), Mr Hofer took 51.9% to 48.1% for Mr Van der Bellen.

{"article": "With the sound of the drums echoing off the walls of the surrounding buildings, it feels as if it could be an impromptu street performance - but it's not. This is tax collecting Bangalore-style. Fed up with companies refusing to pay their tax bills, the city has gone one better than merely sending out reminder letters. Instead it is striking back, shaming local tax avoiders, through the use of music. Bangalore has a clear message to offenders: Pay up or we send in the drummers, and then everybody will know what you've done wrong. And so far, it seems to be working. \"People like this. They gather to hear the drums playing,\" says one of the band, 19-year-old drummer Shankarantha. The band's co-ordinator is K C Chellaiah, who is standing to one side, watching his team in action. He says while the audience might like it - those targeted do not. \"The company owners get afraid of it when the troupe starts beating the drum,\" he says. \"Usually the firms have a good name in their area and when this comes to people's attention and the real picture comes out of it, they start paying their tax immediately - they respond immediately.\" By Yogita LimayeBusiness reporter, BBC News, Bangalore When we went with the drummers to one company located in south-east Bangalore, dozens of people came out of their homes and offices to see what was going on. The lorry that carried the drummers had big banners on the front and sides displaying the name of the company that had evaded tax. However, no-one from the company was present at the office, and civic officials told us this was probably because information about the drum beating had leaked to them somehow. But the authorities did not call off the drumming. In fact they said the main purpose of the drive was to attract the attention of the company's neighbours and to try to shame the firm into paying up. Bangalore's civic body isn't the only one to adopt this method to try to recover taxes. The Delhi city corporation has launched a similar drive, and some years ago in Patna, the capital city of the central India state of Bihar, eunuchs were deployed to sing outside shops that had not paid taxes. 10 things you might not know about India Bangalore is India's third-largest city, and as the centre of the India's hi-tech industry, its economy is worth some $9.6bn (\u00a36.1bn) a year. But it has a problem with unpaid taxes, and so six months ago it started employing its teams of drummers. And it is proving to be steady work for the musicians. Band member Shankarantha says that he and his fellow players have been called out to beat the drum for Bangalore's tax department four times in the past few days. \"Initially we didn't get a good response,\" says Shivakumar CM, an executive engineer with Bangalore Municipal Corporation. \"Since then we have seen that about 50% of the firms we have targeted have come to us to pay up their taxes. \"We're getting a good response from companies which have been embarrassed,\" he says. \"This is the primary motor of the drum-beat programme.\" But Bangalore is not alone in this. India has one of the lowest rates of tax payment in the world. Only 3% of India's population of 1.2 billion pay any tax at all. There are several reasons for this: This year, India's government has decided on a two-pronged approach to its tax problem. First, all those officially listed as earning over $185,000 a year - 42,000 individuals - will have to pay an extra 10% surcharge for one year. The tax rate for higher earners will temporarily rise from 30 to 33%. Yet when you realise that India is reckoned to have 125,000 millionaires, but only a third of them are officially listed as higher-rate tax payers, Delhi's problem becomes clear. Second, the finance ministry has been sending out what it says are \"polite\" reminder letters to 1.2 million people who appear to possess enough wealth to require paying taxes. Instead of focusing on declared income, India's tax collectors are looking at people's spending patterns - what significant payments are made on credit cards, and whether properties or shares have been bought or sold. Estimates of how much tax Delhi is losing vary, but the government itself says people avoided paying some $70m of taxes and duties in the first three months of 2013 alone. Source: World Bank World Bank statistics But improving the tax-collection rate nationally will be a challenge. \"Trying to enhance tax collection from the sectors which are not paying taxes is important,\" says Nikhil Bhatia, executive director at PricewaterhouseCoopers. But before many more Indians would be willing to pay up, he says the government must prove that it is spending the tax revenues it does get efficiently. \"Curbing expenditure which is not fruitful and which is not seen to be a good return on contributions paid by tax payers will also make people a lot more willing to pay.\" Meanwhile back in Bangalore, Shankarantha is busy playing the beats on his drums. But he says he is just happy that people are responding and Bangalore's council is getting more taxes out of it.", "question": "The band of drummers , with their @placeholder shirts and bright bandanas , is beating out a fast - paced tattoo to a small appreciative audience .", "option_0": "prolonged", "option_1": "homes", "option_2": "team", "option_3": "matching", "option_4": "striped", "label": 3}
{"article": "According to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei, the 22 May attack on an open-air market in Urumqi's predominantly Han-populated Shayibake district, which left 31 people dead and 94 injured, demonstrates that Uighur \"terrorists are swollen with arrogance\". The latest attack comes on the heels of the spate of violence so far this year linked to Xinjiang and the Uighur, including the 1 March mass knife attack at Kunming train station and the 30 April knife and bomb attack at Urumqi's central train station. The pattern of the recent attacks does suggest an escalation or even radicalisation of Uighur opposition to Chinese rule. In contrast to past episodes of low-level violence in Xinjiang, which have been characterised by low technology and opportunistic attacks on representatives of the state (e.g. police, public security personnel or government officials), the current spate of violence through its targeting of public spaces is clearly designed to be indiscriminate and mass impact in nature. This change in tactics suggests two immediate possibilities: that this may be a concerted effort to escalate the conflict between not only the Chinese state and Uighur militants themselves but to also further polarise the wider Uighur and Han population in the region; and that Uighur militants are drawing on models more akin to the mass-casualty terrorism that we have come to associate with Al-Qaeda and their ilk. The key question however is: why now? There are two possibilities that suggest themselves. The first relates to the role of what Beijing likes to term \"hostile external influences\" in Xinjiang. This has focused on the potential influence of radical Islamist groups that Beijing has blamed for recent attacks, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and the Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP). ETIM, according to most informed observers, only functioned for a brief period from the late 1990s to early 2000s and petered out soon after the death of its leader, Hasan Mahsum, during a Pakistani military operation in Waziristan in 2003. TIP emerged in 2005 as a successor organisation and is believed to consist of between 200 to 400 militants based near Mir Ali in North Waziristan allied with the Pakistani Taliban and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU). In contrast to ETIM, TIP has had a higher profile due to regular claims made by its leadership in relation to events in Xinjiang (TIP for example has issued statements supporting the Kunming and Urumqi train station attacks) and its use of the Internet as a vehicle to disseminate its calls for \"jihad\" against Chinese rule. TIP's actual operational capabilities, however, are much less clear and given the group's geographic isolation from Xinjiang, its lack of resources and small number of militants, it is probable that its influence in Xinjiang is of an exemplary nature. The second possibility concerns the relationship between Chinese policy in Xinjiang and the apparent trend toward escalating violence. Beijing's goal since the region was incorporated into the PRC in 1949 has been to politically, economically and culturally integrate Xinjiang and its non-Han populations into the \"unitary and multi-ethnic\" Chinese state. It has sought to achieve this through a three-pronged strategy of repression, restriction and investment. Especially since the early 1990s, Beijing has instituted a massive, state-led modernisation project, funnelling billions of dollars into construction and infrastructure linking the region's economy with the rest of the country and neighbouring Central Asia on the assumption that the delivery of economic growth will dampen Uighur discontent. Yet on the contrary state-led modernisation has exacerbated Uighur disaffection by encouraging further Han Chinese settlement of Xinjiang and growing inter-ethnic and urban-rural economic inequalities. Over the same period the state has also rarely let up its willingness to use police and military force to suppress overt displays of Uighur opposition nor its efforts to control and monitor elements of Uighur religious and cultural expression. In a recent example that demonstrates both of these tendencies, Radio Free Asia reported on 20 May that in Alaqagha township near Aksu, authorities had violently suppressed a protest against the detention of women and schoolgirls for wearing the hijab or headscarves, killing up to four protestors. The core problem from this perspective is that Uighur grievances arising from the combined effects of the unevenness of the state's modernisation strategy and its repressive tendencies have no effective or \"legitimate\" outlet. Beijing's treatment of the prominent and outspoken Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti is emblematic of this dynamic. Mr Tohti, a moderate voice who has called for greater autonomy but not independence for Xinjiang, was arrested on 15 January this year for \"inciting separatism\" in his role at the Central University for Nationalities in Beijing. That such a moderate critic, operating from a relatively privileged position and within the parameters of legitimate debate established by the state, can be so rapidly silenced gives us an indication of how marginalised the voices of average Uighurs are in Xinjiang. In this context, the radicalisation of a segment of the population should not be viewed as surprising.

Scape group, which advises local authorities on new buildings, says this amounts to 24,287 more classrooms. But ministers say there is \"significant capacity still in the system... before new places need to be created\". A Department for Education spokeswoman said local authorities would continue to create thousands more school places in coming years, with 600,000 additional pupil places created in the five years to May 2015. \"And we are investing \u00c2\u00a37bn in new places up to 2021,\" the spokeswoman added. However the Local Government Association, which represents 370 councils in England, says its own research suggests that although existing schools have been expanding to cope with the bulge, many have almost run out of space. And once it is no longer possible to increase the size of existing schools - new ones will be needed, the LGA points out. Department for Education figures project 8.6% more primary school pupils in England by 2020 - but the biggest increase will be as children move into secondary school where pupil numbers are expected to rise by 12%. Scape's report says this could amount to the equivalent of more than 2,000 new schools. \"The country will soon start to feel the full weight of the impending boom in pupil numbers and we're already seeing unprecedented pressure on school places. \"A radical new wave of school-building must be a top priority for the government,\" said chief executive Mark Robinson. Scape says demand for places will vary between regions, with London, the south-east and east of England feeling the most pressure - and the north-east and north-west facing more modest increases. The LGA has long been critical of the government's emphasis on free schools as the solution to the places crisis and says Scape's calculations support their argument that powers to open new schools should be returned to councils. They also want academy schools, which are outside local authority control, to have to expand to make sure every child has a place. \"Councils have a statutory duty to ensure every child has a school place available to them but find themselves in the difficult position of not being able to ensure schools, including academies, expand,\" said Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board. \"Finding suitable sponsors with the capacity to take on the running of a successful new school is also proving a challenge.\" The DfE spokeswoman said the system was responding well to growing pupil numbers and thanks to \"hard work and investment, 1.4m more pupils are now in good or outstanding schools than in 2010\".

However, the organisation's head of growth, Jamie Clewer, said: \"We have a real challenge as we move forward with some of the local government cuts around access to facilities and investment. \"That's a real threat to grassroots football so we need to make sure we're working together with national and local government to make sure pitches are accessible.\" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: \"We provide nearly \u00a31m each year, via Sport Wales, to support the development of grassroots football. \"We hope people across the country are inspired to take up the sport by the historic success of Chris Coleman's Wales team.\" A spokesman for Sport Wales said: \"Significant investment has been made in Welsh football. \"We know that football has grown in participation and the current enthusiasm is another catalyst to keep growing the game.\"", "question": "Wales ' participation in Euro 2016 is \" one chance in a million \" to invest in grassroots football , it s most @placeholder player has said .", "option_0": "offers", "option_1": "capped", "option_2": "argued", "option_3": "claimed", "option_4": "group", "label": 1}
{"article": "A story in The Times newspaper suggested that aides to the prime minister were briefing against Simon Stevens. The head of NHS England, it was reported, had been seen by Number 10 as \"insufficiently enthusiastic and responsive\" to the problems facing the service. It was denied by both sides but it seems clear that the relationship is not as warm as it might be. Mr Stevens worked closely with George Osborne, the former chancellor, in launching his five-year plan for the NHS and the funding which underpinned it. He was often in Downing Street for talks with David Cameron. But things have not been the same since the arrival of Theresa May.  It took a while for her to meet Mr Stevens and she does not have the same level of interest in health as her predecessor, predictably perhaps because of the time spent on the Brexit issue. I understand there is a reasonable working relationship though nothing like what Mr Stevens was used to under the Cameron administration. Mrs May's watering down of the obesity strategy, which NHS leaders had developed over many months, did not help matters. Now, though, there is a distinct chill. Just a couple of hours after Mrs May defended government policy against fierce Labour attacks in the Commons, the head of NHS England made it very clear he was not impressed with the funding provided by ministers. There was nothing in what he told MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee which he had not said before. It was the timing and the way he said it. Mr Stevens told the committee that \"like probably every part of the public service we got less than what we asked for\", directly contradicting suggestions by the prime minister and the health secretary that all the funding requested by the service up to 2020 had been promised. He went on to say that spending on the NHS in England per head of population would actually fall in 2018-19. Even as Mr Stevens was providing his sobering analysis of prospects for the NHS, Downing Street had a cutting response ready for reporters. At the time the five-year spending deal was announced, according to the prime minister's spokeswoman, the NHS chief executive had said \"our case for the NHS has been heard and actively supported\". Under the coalition government's controversial health reforms in 2012, NHS England gained more autonomy. The idea was that health service leaders could operate with less political interference. But the problem is that ministers still have to go to the dispatch box in the Commons to defend the performance of the NHS even though they have less control over it. The latest developments have underlined that for Mrs May. It suits Mr Stevens to let it be known that he did not get the money he wanted for the NHS. It suits Downing Street to suggest that NHS England has changed its tune over a financial settlement which it initially welcomed. This might not matter much in normal times but right now divisions at the top will do nothing to help the NHS cope with its harshest ever winter.", "question": "The NHS is facing unprecedented pressures .

His mother Joanne Mison, of Shotley Gate, Suffolk, said she was convinced that her son Tyler had died after experimenting with a \"choking game\". Dr Dean said the death may have been due to some form of high-risk game. But he added it was difficult to say if that was what had happened. Police said they could find no clues to indicate why Tyler, who was born in Manchester, had hanged himself and no evidence he had been playing a choking game. Dr Dean said Tyler had seemed a \"normal happy lad\" and there was no evidence to suggest that he intended to take his own life. Tyler was, said his parents, a happy, but easily led boy. A pupil at Holbrook High School in Shotley, he was planning to join the Army Cadet Force. On 9 September last year he was found by his stepfather hanging from his bed at home. Mrs Mison said she was sure he had been trying a choking game which, she said, youngsters played to give themselves a \"high\", the inquest heard. She said in the weeks before his death Tyler had had bloodshot eyes, headaches and marks on his neck. Mrs Mison said she had thought nothing of them at the time but with hindsight felt that they were classic signs of choking game experiments. She said: \"I had never heard of 'the choking game' before. But it is well-known in America and you can find it on the internet. \"I think teachers, parents, anyone who works with children should be made aware of the signs and the dangers.\" The government said in a statement: \"We believe that this practice is still relatively rare and unknown in most schools. \"On balance, we feel that a national awareness campaign may give the practice unwanted publicity and increase the risk that more children may experiment with it.\"", "question": "The mother of a boy who hanged himself has called on internet sites to erase anything which could @placeholder experiments with strangulation .", "option_0": "suggest", "option_1": "encourage", "option_2": "reveal", "option_3": "face", "option_4": "marry", "label": 1}

{"article": "\"Four weeks,\" Martin McGuinness, standing next to him, clarified. That was before Sinn F\u00e9in's northern chair was arrested then released by detectives investigating the murder of Kevin McGuigan Sr. It was also before the SDLP resisted pressure to adjourn the assembly and before the DUP's ministerial team resigned or stood aside, with the notable exception of Finance Minister and now Acting First Minister Arlene Foster. All of which was pretty dramatic, but by the end of the week Martin McGuinness reckoned we had six weeks to save the process, which by my calculation was an extra fortnight. Under the Northern Ireland Act, Mrs Foster can only occupy her 'acting' role for a continuous period of no more than six weeks. But a senior DUP source pointed out that a five-minute return to office by Peter Robinson could interrupt such a \"continuous\" period, enabling Mrs Foster to step back into the breach on repeated occasions. That's not the only area where we will have to be alert for Baldrick-style 'cunning plans'. Peter Robinson told me on Inside Politics he has no intention of letting Sinn F\u00e9in and SDLP ministers take over the health, enterprise and social development departments his colleagues have just vacated. Presumably the plan would be to nominate DUP politicians to take over the vacant departments within the seven-day timescale set by the rules, then have them step down again almost immediately. All this procedural game-playing will be in parallel with renewed Stormont House talks. It seems unlikely the tactical manoeuvring will last as long as six weeks, not least because the public might regard it as too clever by half. On BBC Newsline I pointed out that the absence of a regional development minister already meant that some common sense measures, like speed restrictions near rural primary schools, were not getting rubber-stamped. One can imagine similar practical negative impacts if there are no ministers in charge of health or housing for extended periods. With David Cameron still appearing to rule suspension out, the parties remain well aware that sooner or later over the next eight months they are likely to be throwing themselves at the mercy of the voters. Maybe by then we will have another 'historic' deal covering welfare reform, the budget, corporation tax, paramilitary activity, parades, the past and the weakness of the current Stormont system.

{"article": "The proposed job cuts are in addition to the 7,500 job losses Shell announced in July. The tie-up between Shell and BG deal is due to be completed early next year. However, an institutional investor has told the BBC that the deal does not make \"financial sense\" at current oil price levels. David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, told the BBC it was \"very difficult to make the deal work\" with oil below $40 a barrel, saying oil prices needed to be $60-$70 a barrel. Shell announced in April that it had agreed to buy BG, in a deal that valued the oil and gas exploration firm at about \u00c2\u00a347bn. In its latest statement, Shell said that the planned job losses were part of \"operational and administrative restructuring\". \"Further detailed work will be undertaken on the details of the proposed restructuring as part of ongoing integration planning,\" Shell said. The final regulatory barrier to the Shell-BG tie-up was cleared on Monday after it was approved by China. It has already been approved by regulators in Australia, Brazil and the European Union. Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said the companies would now \"seek approval from both sets of shareholders as we move towards deal completion in early 2016\". Last week, the price of oil fell to seven-year lows, with both Brent crude and US crude now below $40 a barrel. Speaking before Shell announced the plans for job cuts, Mr Cumming told the BBC's Today programme that - given the low oil price - possible options included  Shell walking away from the deal, Shell changing the terms of the deal, or shareholders rejecting the  deal. \"Shareholders could vote the deal down, and the break fee is pretty low, so I think Shell will come under pressure over the next few months to say how the deal is going to work,\" Mr Cumming added.

{"article": "Today, it was back to the Scottish Play and the dramatis personae of Holyrood. Labour's Kezia Dugdale seemed to want to truncate the \"seven ages of man\" (or woman), as numbered in As You Like It. Not sure if we got our due quota of \"wise saws and modern instances\". The exchanges with Labour (on housing) were decidedly tetchy. The exchanges with the Tories (on flooding) were perhaps too raw to admit of oratory. But certainly politicians have to pay heed to the \"bubble reputation\", particularly as expressed via opinion polls in the run-up to May's election - which is, of course, dominating their every waking thought and quite a few of the somnolent ones too. But back to the seven ages. Labour has produced a plan to top up the bonus paid to those saving for a first home mortgage. Ms Dugdale was keen to contrast that offer with what she saw as a lackadaisical approach by the Scottish government. She chose to word that contrast in personal terms. Her youthful generation, she said, was increasingly confined to the private rented sector. By contradistinction, the First Minister's generation had found it easier to buy their home. Now I know that the word \"generation\" has gained a degree of elasticity since its not infrequent use during the referendum. However, this was perhaps stretching things too far. Ms Dugdale is indeed relatively young, being aged 34. But Ms Sturgeon is only a decade ahead of her, at 45. Wisely, Ms Sturgeon declined to bridle. The topic was far too serious. Instead, the First Minister argued that her government had already taken considerable steps to help first time buyers - from shared equity to cutting the tax on lower-cost homes to increasing the housing supply. In which regard she quoted Iain Gray, sitting beside Ms Dugdale, to the effect that a previous Labour government at Holyrood had been hot on housing policy - but perhaps a little cooler on building houses. Mr Gray gestured dismissively. Ms Dugdale was unimpressed. Young folk (presumably including herself, although not the FM) had been given a \"raw deal\" by SNP Ministers who lacked the ambition to counter austerity in a radical fashion. The First Minister implied that Labour leaders were free to offer virtually anything - because they did not expect to be in office after May. Rather, they were struggling to hold on to second place. And so the exchanges went on, \"sudden and quick in quarrel\". From future homes to those presently afflicted by flood water. Ruth Davidson accused the Scottish government of dragging their heels in distributing \u00c2\u00a35m in cash which formed part of a UK government package to help householders and others. Ms Sturgeon said this characterisation was unfair. She noted grimly that the flood waters had yet to recede, that the full impact was not yet assessed.  Urgent consultations were under way, she said, to ensure that the cash was effectively distributed. An announcement was pending. This was the Liberal Democrats' fallow week - their paucity of numbers means they don't get a question at every outing. However, up stepped Patrick Harvie of the Greens. He was sceptical about the Chancellor's plans for a National Living Wage, arguing that it would not compensate for cuts in welfare payments. He was particularly unhappy that the higher rate will only be paid to those aged 25 and over. Mr Harvie suggested sanctions by confining Scottish government support to those who provide the higher rate to all staff. In response, Ms Sturgeon essayed the approach emollient. She sympathised with Mr Harvie's stance but argued that it was important to act consensually with employers, to convince them that what she called a \"fair work approach\" could benefit business as well as employees.

Matej Vydra scored the only goal with 20 minutes remaining, firing high into the net after QPR goalkeeper Alex Smithies kept out Tom Ince's low shot. Idrissa Sylla headed against the post late on for QPR, who suffered only their second defeat in eight games. Ian Holloway's in-form Rangers had offered little in attack before that, and they remain 10 points clear of the relegation zone, having taken 16 points from their previous seven Championship matches. Derby had drawn their first game under Rowett at local rivals Nottingham Forest prior to the international break, coming from behind to lead and then conceding a stoppage-time equaliser. But they built on an impressive second-half display at the City Ground to give new boss Rowett, a former Derby defender, his first win in charge. Winger Johnny Russell missed several opportunities for the hosts during a goalless first half, while Smithies kept out David Nugent's powerful angled drive. It appeared as if Derby would be punished for their wastefulness, but Czech striker Vydra netted for the second game in succession to secure three points and deny Rangers what would have been only their third league clean sheet of 2017.

{"article": "The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) had asked the Udta Punjab filmmakers to make 94 cuts, including removal of expletives, references to cities in Punjab and any shots of drugs being consumed, ironically in a film about drug abuse. But Anurag Kashyup and other producers decided to challenge the CBFC's order in a Mumbai court, which eventually allowed the film's release with just one cut - a shot of lead actor Shahid Kapoor's character urinating in a crowd. \"I must confess that I was aware that it was not going to be easy to get [the film] out there. But I didn't anticipate the amount of conflict we would have to go through,\" Kapoor told the BBC. But he added that \"the controversy helped the film\" because many Indians used social media outlets to show their support for creative freedom in India. \"The film got leaked two days before it was set for release but we still had people going into the theatres, which is amazing,\" he said. The dispute has even gripped university professors in India. Some business schools are now using Udta Punjab as an example of how a public row can help drive interest in a film and raise awareness about a social issue. But will one film's victory be enough to prevent heavy-handed censorship in the future? Actress Alia Bhatt said more steps were needed to ensure complete creative freedom. She added that the \"interpretation of the 1952 cinematography law\" creates problems because \"it's a bit vague and can be interpreted in any way\". She argued that the law has to be changed. Many have concerns even about the single cut ordered by the Bombay high court. Bhatt, who is one of the most promising actresses in the latest generation of Bollywood stars, wants to see censorship disappear completely. \"As an adult, you're allowed to vote, you're allowed to drink, you're allowed to get married, then how can you not be allowed to view cuss words, or abusive words, or a kissing scene, or bloodshed or any of that on screen?\" she asked. Javed Akhtar, co-writer of cult films like Sholay, said we shouldn't view Udta Punjab \"as a one off case\". \"Censorship in India has always been quite erratic and quite irrational and ad hoc,\" he said. Last year, the CBFC asked the producers of Hindi thriller NH10 to shorten the duration of a violent scene that showed honour killing, had the word \"lesbian\" muted in romantic comedy Dum Laga Ke Haisha and banned erotic romance Fifty Shades of Grey despite the producers offering to make cuts. The board also shortened the duration of two kissing scenes in Daniel Craig's Spectre before giving it an adult certification. Akhtar argued that the board needs better people to avoid these incidents. \"People who are from the arts, people who are from the theatre, people who are familiar with literature and drama should be on the panel,\" he said. Udta Punjab's successful court battle has encouraged others to fight for their creative freedom. Actor and producer Anil Kapoor has bought the rights to adapt American TV sitcom Modern Family for India. Some consider it a risky move because a gay couple play a central part in the series and homosexuality is currently illegal in the country. Anil Kapoor told the BBC that he was not going to compromise the characters. \"Things are changing. I'm under no pressure, I'm going to have the track as it is,\" he said. The actor added that he had faith in India's legal system. \"Today, we have the biggest advantage of social media and the public opinion is the most important thing anywhere in the world. So I'm ready to fight if there's anything like [censorship],\" he said. Anil Kapoor's confidence comes partly from the growth of the internet and streaming services like Netflix in South Asia. \"We have the digital format platform now, so there is a possibility that I might make it [the series] for the digital platform,\" he said. But \"moral policing\" has been noticeable online in India too. In February 2015, viral stand-up comedy group AIB took down a \"comedy roast show\" from YouTube, featuring Bollywood stars, after complaints of vulgar language. Nonetheless, there have been fewer cases compared with films. Instead, several top Bollywood stars, including Deepika Padukone, Shah Rukh Khan and Bhatt, have been involved in creating original content for the internet which has been received positively. But is going online the best way of tackling the CBFC or is it just avoiding the issue all together?

{"article": "European Council President Donald Tusk's invitation letter to the two-day summit in Brussels this week admits gloomily \"the catalogue of issues to be resolved before we can conclude an agreement is long\". Turkey is the key, and Turkey is the lock. The youthful, populous, problematic Muslim country is a practical conundrum and an existential threat to the EU's self-definition, seen by some as the classic shadow image, the threat of the other. Before I get carried away, it was obvious from the start that the deal was flawed, forced and bound to be opposed with vehemence. Left and right, ancient and modern, north and south are joined in rebellion against Mrs Merkel and the planned EU deal with Turkey. It is not so much snagged on a nail, fraying at the edges, as already unravelled before the summit, little more than a pile of wool lying on the floor. To pick up the threads and knit it into anything serviceable will be a painstaking labour of necessity. Perhaps it has already done its job. The EU does not thrive on surprises, and this deal came as a brutal shock. That in politics can be a masterstroke. But to be so it has to delight, rather than dismay, those who are taken unawares. It was a cobbled-together plan that would reward Turkey for taking back every migrant who arrived on Greek shores from their country. In return for each such desperate soul, another - apparently more deserving - would be taken from Turkey and sent to a willing European Union country. Angela Merkel and her consigliere Donald Tusk strongarmed a deal ahead of German elections in which migration was a major issue. While the elections were not exactly a triumph for the chancellor, they were also not quite the rout some of her opponents claim. At least it looked for a short while that she had a road map out of crisis. But only hours after the deal was done the UN declared that the policy could be illegal. Spain will now champion this view at this week's summit, with the acting foreign minister declaring to El Pais: \"Anyone arriving on European territory must have the right to individualised attention, to filing an asylum request that will be taken into consideration, and to appeal if the request is denied. Throughout this process, any possibility of expulsion is suspended.\" It is hard to see how an organisation almost painfully conscious of its responsibility to international law can have extricated this particular spanner from this piece of work. The EU leaders said \"bold moves\" were needed, and made the following proposals: But liberal worries about legality are not the half of it. The exhortation that the passport-free area should be re-established, even as new barbed wire fences were going up between Slovenia and Croatia, always seemed unrealistic. So did urging a \"coalition of the willing\" to take new refugees when traditionally open countries were shutting their doors. But this is not any old agreement; it is an agreement with Turkey. The Hungarian prime minister, echoing the rhetoric of some Brexiteers, has declared it is all a plot to create a super-state. Viktor Orban has said: \"If we want to stop the mass migration, first we must put the brakes on Brussels,\" adding that he would say the unsayable. \"It is forbidden to say that the arriving masses from other cultures are a threat to our way of life, our culture, our habits and our Christian traditions.\" That perhaps goes to the dark heart of the problem with this deal, with its promise of visa-free travel for Turks. Those worried by a seeming endless flow of Syrian refugees are not reassured by the idea of swapping that reality for the possibility of open access to Turkey's 75 million people and dangling eventual EU membership in front of them. The Turks, too, are willing to work for lower wages and, in the minds of some, representatives of an alien culture. Francois Hollande has proclaimed his opposition to the plan. France, like Austria, has suggested Turkey can never join. The UK has in the past stood firm against this view. Labour and Conservative governments have championed the importance of a Muslim Nato ally that  straddles Asia and Europe being bought closer into the Western fold. Now the danger of losing the UK's referendum on EU membership may prevent Mr Cameron making this old argument. Ironically it is the EU's continued rebuffs that have made it easier for President Erdogan to become more authoritarian and more Islamist in his politics. But the British view is from a small island, far away from the action.  The UK was never occupied by the Ottomans, as Hungary, Bulgaria,  Romania, Greece and much of the Balkans once were. The Turks were never at the gates of London as they were at Vienna. Mock if you like, but such history is bone deep. The EU was built to overcome deeply ingrained hostility between nations but breaking down some walls can reinforce others. The founders of a political Europe were not explicit that this was to be a geographically limited Christian club but some of their heirs are. It is one of the profound questions that faces the EU if it wishes to survive - whether it is defined by geography, culture or philosophy. One piece of recent history above all threatens to derail any deal. In 1974, the same year as Enoch Powell resigned from the Tory party because, he said, Edward Heath had taken the UK into the European Economic Community without a mandate to do so, Turkey invaded Cyprus, an island that had enjoyed both Ottoman and British rule before being fractiously shared between two fiercely nationalist communities. The island is still partitioned but the EU member state Cyprus will block any deal unless Turkey honours an agreement to recognise the island as a single country - something that seems highly unlikely. Turkey has Europe over a barrel and might enjoy giving it a spanking after years of contempt and distain. This newfound political clout produces an equal and opposite reaction. Its demand for more cash has been called \"blackmail\" by the forthright Czech president. This is a deal that also probably needs approval by the Greek and Turkish parliaments, but don't worry about that - it isn't likely to survive much beyond the weekend. It won't vanish. Mrs Merkel won't give up. The crisis wont fade from the headlines. The EU will find some sort of agreement, eventually. The old metaphor for the European Union was a train, and the question was whether you were on it or not. Nowadays it is more like being stuck in a traffic jam on a motorway, with the kids in the back moaning \"Are we there yet?\", the driver fulminating about the impossibility of turning round or backing out. After Mrs Merkel's speedy breakthrough, progress will be at a snail's pace and the relationship with Turkey may be changed profoundly during the journey.", "question": "Even as people struggle and @placeholder on the river border between Greece and Macedonia the proposed solution to Europe 's migration crisis is dissolving before our very eyes .", "option_0": "climbed", "option_1": "appear", "option_2": "listen", "option_3": "fight", "option_4": "drown", "label": 4}

{"article": "The Department for International Development (DfID) said last month the secretariat in London was \"under performing\" and needed \"urgent reform\". Senior diplomatic and political sources - speaking to the BBC off the record - have accused the secretary-general, Lady Scotland, of \"poor leadership\". But her spokesman said she had backing from all 52 Commonwealth countries that had elected her. He added that the Labour peer had also launched a programme to modernise the Commonwealth Secretariat. Tim Hitchens, a senior Foreign Office official and former ambassador to Japan, has been put in charge of a team preparing for the Commonwealth summit in London next year. Mr Hitchens, a former assistant private secretary to the Queen, will be based in the Cabinet Office and will report directly to the prime minister. Sir Simon Gass, a very senior official who retired from the Foreign Office last year, has been made acting chief operating officer at the Commonwealth Secretariat. He was appointed at the suggestion of the Foreign Office which is funding his salary. He is working directly with Lady Scotland at the secretariat's headquarters at Marlborough House in London. The appointments are being seen in Whitehall as an attempt by the government to shore up a troubled organisation at a crucial time. Ministers are keen to ensure that a meeting of Commonwealth trade ministers in London in March is a success and shows how Britain after Brexit can do more trade with countries outside the European Union. They also want to guarantee that the secretariat is capable of organising the heads of government summit next year that will be hosted by the Queen, who is head of the Commonwealth. Senior ministers will meet next week to discuss the agenda for the summit for the first time. Last week, Theresa May spoke of the \"unique and proud global relationships\" the UK has through the Commonwealth. The secretariat helps run the group of 52 mostly former British colonies that make up the Commonwealth and that are home to some 2.3 billion people, more than a quarter of the world's population. In a highly critical report in December, DfID threatened to withdraw its funding from the organisation unless it improved its performance. \"The Commonwealth Secretariat continues to under perform,\" the multilateral aid review concluded. \"Improvement is essential if DfID is to continue to fund the organisation's Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation.\" This is worth about \u00c2\u00a320m per year. The report added that the secretariat needed particularly to focus on improving \"transparency, results measurement, human resource management, risk management, financial management, and budget discipline\". The secretariat said the review related to the period before Lady Scotland took up the post of secretary-general last April. Since then, the peer - who was attorney general in Gordon Brown's government - has faced much criticism. She has been accused of financial extravagance over the refurbishment of her official residence and attacked for appointing political allies to key posts in the secretariat. She has always denied the accusations of wasteful spending and insisted no procurement rules were broken. Her allies have also claimed the attacks were prompted by disaffected Commonwealth staff unhappy with the reforms she was introducing. A spokesman for the secretariat said: \"Secretary-general Patricia Scotland has the backing of the 52 Commonwealth member states who elected her. \"Since taking office on 1 April 2016, the Secretary-general has been focused on helping Commonwealth countries to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, working towards the delivery of international climate change goals set out after Cop 21 in Paris and Cop 22 in Marrakesh, and to uphold The Commonwealth Charter.\" \"She has identified the following priorities: tackling the existential threat of climate change; promoting trade, good governance and human rights; ending violence against women and girls and promoting gender equality; and providing new opportunities for Commonwealth young people and enabling the next generation to achieve their full potential. \"Secretary-general Scotland has also launched a programme to modernise the Commonwealth Secretariat. \"When it comes to employee matters, we follow best international practice and never comment about individual staff. But it's only sensible that the Secretariat employs people of the highest calibre and those who have a track record of success in their respective fields.\" But such are the concerns about Lady Scotland that some senior diplomats have even interpreted the fact that the Queen will not attend a major Commonwealth function in March as a signal of royal displeasure, something that is strongly denied. The Queen will attend various events on Commonwealth Day, including a service at Westminster Abbey, but she will not attend the regular reception at Marlborough House, an event she rarely misses. A Buckingham Palace spokesman told the BBC: \"I can confirm that the Queen will be taking part in events during the course of Commonwealth Day, although on this occasion she will not attend the evening reception. Her Majesty will be represented at the reception by the Prince of Wales.\" Well placed royal sources said this was a common sense and practical decision to ensure the Queen's programme was suitably paced on a busy day. They also insisted it was wholly incorrect to link the decision to any debate about the Commonwealth Secretariat. They noted that the Queen had regular contact with Lady Scotland and that there was a lot  of precedence for the Prince of Wales to represent the Queen on Commonwealth duties. But that is not how it is being inferred by some in the Commonwealth. One senior source said: \"The Queen has only got to nip down the road from Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House in a Bentley. It's not that hard. And yet she has decided not to come. \"The Palace are thinking there is so much more to be done with the Commonwealth and yet they are lumbered with such poor leadership. The Commonwealth is stuffed. \"The High Commissioners have all given up on (Lady Scotland). They have other fish to fry. I do wonder if she can survive. She just treats people appallingly. And she has this political tin ear.\" One parliamentary source said: \"Baroness Scotland has got this wrong from the beginning. It is an inbuilt arrogance. She appoints mates, people who don't have the relevant experience. \"The way she handled the [official] house was all wrong. There is a lot of concern. I am not surprised the palace is getting a little edgy.\" Another diplomatic source said: \"What is happening is very sad. The morale at the secretariat is very low. [The Commonwealth] is the closest thing to Her Majesty's heart. If she doesn't come, it will be interpreted in this way. \"We in the Commonwealth preach transparency and accountability.

{"article": "The weed is one of the most destructive plants in the UK. The new rules mean people can now be fined up to \u00c2\u00a32,500 for failing to control it and other plants such as Himalayan balsam and giant hogweed. And companies who fall foul of the law can be fined up to \u00c2\u00a320,000. Businesses in Scotland and Northern Ireland already have a legal responsibility to prevent invasive plants from spreading into the wild or causing a nuisance. The Home Office says these plants threaten the UK's biodiversity by crowding out native species and destabilising river banks. They can also do immense harm to forestry, farms, roads and buildings. Japanese knotweed can grow through tarmac and cause structural damage to  properties, while giant hogweed can create serious health problems for humans, such as blisters, skin diseases and even blindness. Japanese knotweed is particularly difficult to eradicate. It is very resilient and regrows vigorously after being cut down. The most effective method of eradicating it is by using herbicides in the late summer or autumn, when it is close to its flowering stage. Scientists are hoping psyllids - insects that devour Japanese Knotweed but leave other crops or flowers alone - will also be able to help control the spread of the plant. Field tests are taking place at secret sites. Property lawyer Laurence Lacey told the BBC that Japanese Knotweed can create problems for people trying to buy or sell a property. He said: \"It can have an adverse impact on valuation. Lenders may refuse to lend on it, and for that reason it's a case of informing yourself as much as possible about whether it's a problem in a property you're looking at.\" Mr Lacey also said that if Japanese Knotweed was present in a property, it should be dealt with by a specialist who provides a warranty. Some have criticised the introduction of penalties such as fines and Asbos as a method of dealing with the problem of invasive plants. Helen Yemm, who writes the Thorny Problems column in the Telegraph Gardening newspaper section, said the issue had been \"whipped up and is playing on people's fear\". She added: \"It's sad to have legislation that puts one neighbour against another, and is a sad reflection on our times, really.\"", "question": "People who fail to control the spread of invasive non-native plants such as Japanese Knotweed could be fined or receive anti-social @placeholder orders ( Asbos ) , the government says .", "option_0": "conduct", "option_1": "life", "option_2": "behaviour", "option_3": "show", "option_4": "goods", "label": 2}
{"article": "They would be informed about the nature of the defence's case and given details about court procedures, if proposed guidance for prosecutors is accepted. Alison Saunders said alleged victims of crime in England and Wales should not be \"ambushed\" in the witness box. Prosecutors should test evidence, not put witnesses \"on trial\", she said. As part of the proposed guidance witnesses would be told if third party material that could undermine the prosecution case had been disclosed to the defence. Witnesses should be encouraged to ask the advocate or judge to repeat or rephrase questions and should be reminded they can ask to see their witness statement, the plans propose. Ms Saunders - the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales - has proposed the changes, saying that asking someone to come to court \"without any idea of what they face in the witness box does not seem fair to me\". \"To stand up in a formal setting and to be asked sometimes difficult and personal questions in front of a court full of strangers is a very big ask,\" she added. She said cross examination of witnesses was \"a vital part\" of the court process, but courts could be made to be \"fairer for victims and witnesses, while maintaining the vital balance which ensures fair trials for those in the dock\". \"I am convinced that we owe it to those who are willing to come to court to help them as much as we can,\" she added. But Tony Cross QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 he is \"deeply\" concerned about the proposal. \"The Court of Appeal has clearly set out that training or coaching for witnesses in criminal proceedings - this applies to prosecution and defence witnesses - is simply not permitted,\" he said. \"Our system of justice involves the confrontation - if I can put it that way - between the prosecution and defence as to what the witness is about to say, which should happen in the presence of the jury, not in a private room which the jury is not party to.\" Last year, former director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer said victims of violent crime faced an \"unacceptable ordeal in the courtroom\".

{"article": "At a UN oceans summit, delegates from China, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines said they would work to keep plastics out of the seas. Some of the promises are not yet formalised and environmentalists say the measures proposed are not nearly urgent enough. But UN officials praised the statement. Meeting in New York, they said it was part of a clear international shift against ocean pollution. Eric Solheim, the UN's environment director, told BBC News: \"There are quite encouraging signs, with nations taking the ocean much more seriously. Of course, there is a very long way to go because the problems are huge.\" It is estimated that 5-13 million tonnes of plastics flow into the world's oceans annually. Much of it is ingested by birds and fish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and fragments of plastic have even been found in organisms at the bottom of the ocean. A recent paper said much of the marine plastic often originates far from the sea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially in countries which have developed consumer economies faster than their ability to manage waste. The  Helmholtz Centre in Leipzig, Germany, estimated that 75% of land-borne marine pollution comes from just 10 rivers, predominantly in Asia. Reducing the plastic loads in these rivers by 50% would reduce global plastic inputs by 37%, it said. Tom Dillon from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which campaign on oceans, urged China to move quickly. He told BBC News: \"For thousands of years the Maritime Silk Road was a pathway for export of Chinese culture and influence. Will the ocean be a vehicle for export of Chinese pollution, or a new culture of conservation and sustainability?\" A report to the UN conference from the Thailand government says most marine plastic debris is land-based, caused by inefficient waste management and poor handling of plastic wastes. In Thailand, the total amount of garbage finding its way into the sea was estimated at 2.83 million tonnes in 2016 - of which 12% was plastic. The Thai government says the nation has established a 20-year strategy to tackle the problem, including developing financial incentives for keeping plastic out of the sea and encouraging eco-packaging design and eco-friendly substitutes for plastics. In Indonesia, the government is starting a mass education programme for schoolchildren, and in the Philippines new laws are being developed. Part of the challenge is finding substitutes for plastics.

{"article": "Most try to paint their organisation as a picture of nirvana, but Mark Dodson doesn't bother. To the head of the Scottish Rugby Union, there's really no point. Dodson knows how fiendishly difficult it is to fund the game right now, from professional club rugby to the grassroots and everything in between. The Pro12 has many strengths, but a cash cow it is not. The league makes about \u00a312m a year in broadcast revenues. That compares with north of \u00a340m a year in the Premiership in England and, from the 2019-20 season, \u00a376m a year in France. The financial gap to the big leagues was always wide, but for the Scots and their Celtic cousins it's only getting wider and more troubling. The Celtic nations are vulnerable. TV cash continues to flood into the markets of their near-neighbours like a fast-running river giving them a vastly increased spending - and poaching - power. Last season, Bath wanted David Denton, formerly of Edinburgh, and they cheerily coughed up six figures to get him out of his contract early. Racing 92 wanted Leone Nakarawa, Glasgow's one-time totem, and they slapped down a wad of notes in front of Scottish Rugby chiefs to get him out of Glasgow before time. That's on top of the rock 'n' roll salary they're paying him, the kind of sum that Glasgow couldn't hope to match in their wildest dreams. Who's the next target of the wealthy raiders from England and France? Stuart Hogg? Jonny Gray? WP Nel? John Hardie? One thing is certain - the better these guys play for their clubs, the more chance they have of getting an offer that their employers couldn't hope to match. \"The truth is that the French and the English have stolen a march and we understand that we have to look at ourselves,\" says Dodson. \"If we don't do something with the Pro 12, I think it's a bleak prospect. \"We're finding it very difficult to hang on to our top players. Even the people who aren't leaving are demanding more. Unless we do something different we're going to struggle.\" Scotland have, more or less, maxed-out on their revenue streams. They've sold the naming rights to Murrayfield to BT. They've got broadcast revenues that are now at the top of their cycle and it's still not enough. On Saturday, Dodson will announce record turnover of \u00a347.3m - \"an historic high\" - but it does little to breach the financial gap when some of the English and French heavy-hitters have got multi-millionaires (or billionaires) at the helm \"hoovering up the best players in the world.\" The notion of expanding the Pro12 into America has been floated in the recent past. It's still floating. The embryonic plan would see one or two American clubs from the east coast parachuted into the league in time for the 2018-19 season. These clubs would have coaching and player assistance from the Celtic nations in the beginning, a sharing of knowledge of personnel. Super Rugby has shown that the travel issue can be overcome with clever scheduling and enough money in the game. Quite where the Italians fit in is not clear. It sounds fanciful, but you can't mistake Dodson's intent, driven by a need to bring more money into his organisation to avoid an exodus of talent. \"We've got to identify markets that matter and we have to be open-minded,\" he says.  \"To stay as we are isn't really an option. It's been out in the press that we will look at the eastern seaboard of North America (New York, Boston, Atlanta) to explore a new market that could provide a new team or two teams along with broadcast income. I think it's something we have to do. \"I understand why people would think it unrealistic. What we are doing now is working with individuals who are testing those markets for us. We're going to find out if it's feasible. We have to see if the big cities, and their businesses, want to invest. \"Our indications are that there is an amount of interest from American rugby and corporate America. There'll be a process that takes place over the next two to three months that will flush it out. There's a new mindset in the Pro12 now. I think it's appropriate that we do this - and that we do it with some speed. \"We don't want to leave this to 2020, we have to make this happen in a fairly short period of time or find something else. We're seriously investigating the possibility. I'd like to think it'll happen. It's the most attractive market that we can see.\" Dodson also spoke of the conundrum that is the global rugby season, the vexed business of the major nations, from the northern and southern hemisphere, trying to agree on a universal Test-match calendar. Such chat has been going on for many years and there's scarcely been an inch of progress made. \"We've had a debate since 2007 and nothing happens. We meet periodically around the world. \"We find that we can't agree on very much. The northern hemisphere wants one thing and the southern hemisphere wants another. \"There's been endless conversations. We'd prefer a harmonised global season, but if we can't come to a conclusion then we'll do what is right for us. If that means we have home and away Six Nations and no autumn internationals and no summer tours then I'd be up for that. \"You'd play a Six Nations pod in November and then another in its traditional slot in the spring.  It wouldn't be ideal, but I'll look at anything. If we can't get a common understanding on a global season then we have to do what is right for our teams because that's what everyone else is doing. \"If we're going to be pressured by people to change our season and we lose millions of pounds as a result then I'm not for being pushed around.\"", "question": "You do n't tend to hear chief executives of major sporting @placeholder talking about \" bleak prospects \" and \" perfect storms . \"", "option_0": "bodies", "option_1": "franchises", "option_2": "words", "option_3": "article", "option_4": "worlds", "label": 0}

{"article": "Bred originally as fighting dogs, the reputation of the Staffordshire bull terrier often precedes it. And when the BBC's Dog Map appeared on 18 January, a fierce debate broke out on social media. Painted by many as aggressive, vicious and worthy of a place on the \"dangerous dogs\" list, every negative view was in turn met by a barrage of positive praise citing the breed's loyalty and affectionate character. \"No surprise to see Staffies popular in big cities where gangs of chavs live and people use them to guard homes,\" said one user. \"The usual brush is tarring the Staffy,\" said another. \"I'm not a chav and neither are the good people I know that also own Staffs.\" So why do the dogs have such a negative reputation? And why do we judge in the first place? \"They're one of those breeds that has a negative stigma attached to them and one of those is around 'chav culture',\" said Dr Thomas Fletcher, a senior lecturer at Leeds Beckett University. \"You hear stories about dangerous dogs and [people] being mauled and a pattern emerges about the type of breed that's [involved]. \"Staffies do have a particularly bad reputation, but it is important to recognise that those we hear about represent the minority of the breed. I think it's as much to do with the owner. Animals are individuals and I think it's very much about nurture over nature.\" Dr Fletcher recently completed a study with dog-walkers about the relationships between humans and animals. \"The majority of coverage of Staffies represents them as the dog of choice among certain groups - white working class youths - or 'chavs' - being one of those,\" adds Dr Fletcher. \"Rarely are Staffies portrayed in a domestic setting - i.e., in 'normal' family life. \"Staffies come with a degree of baggage in that respect as they have emerged as a modern-day folk devil. Their reputation then may demarcate boundaries between social groups. Again, these boundaries may be defined along class lines. \"But equally there are dogs that can be a marker of other [traits], like sexuality. \"It comes down to social norms and the expectations - who should be walking the dog and what we associate with certain people, than the breed itself. \"If a gang turned up with a dachshund it wouldn't have the same impact.\" Elvira Meucci, campaigns director for the Dogs Trust, said dog choice and image extended beyond Staffies and \"chav culture\". \"There's no doubt that you're saying something about your personality [with your dog],\" she said. \"Staffordshire bull terriers are powerful-looking dogs and therefore they can be used to portray their owners as strong and macho, just as a Chihuahua is the choice of girls who want to look trendy. \"If you look back at how dogs have been used, it does change. [At one time] it was Dobermans, because they're big and powerful dogs and that makes a statement.\" Staffordshire bull terriers are not banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act, but are often confused with banned breeds like pit bulls, Ms Meucci added. That being said, Staffies have made headlines for aggressive acts. In 2011 a girl's pet Chihuahua was mauled to death by four Staffies while a dog owner was given a suspended sentenced in 2013 after his dog decapitated another dog. The same year, teenager Jade Anderson was killed after she was attacked by four dogs in Greater Manchester, two of which were Staffordshire bull terriers. But Coroner Alan Walsh told her inquest the problem was not specific breeds, but the control of dogs in general. According to microchipping data, 356,000 Staffies have been tagged in the past decade by pet registration companies. The statistics perhaps fly in the face of concerns that Staffies should be given a wide berth. But being the dog de jour is a double-edged sword, with over-breeding, a saturated market and owners who do not commit long term contributing to the number of Staffies ending up in shelters. In 2013 more than a third of the dogs that came through the doors of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home were Staffordshire bull terriers. Bill Lambert, from the Kennel Club, said Staffies are not naturally aggressive and were one of the only breeds it recommended as suitable around children. \"We have seen enormous growth in the popularity of Staffordshire bull terriers in the last 20 years and there's no doubt that some of that has come about because of an increase in status dogs,\" he said. \"However, the fact is that they're a dog that doesn't deserve the image it's been given. They need a lot of socialising when they're puppies, but that's down to the owners. \"Any dog can be trained to be a bad dog, just as they can trained to be a good dog.\"", "question": "Research by BBC News shows Staffordshire bull terriers are the third most popular dog in the UK .

{"article": "The shadow education secretary told a teachers' union conference a future Labour government, would give teachers \"the respect that you deserve\". He attacked the coalition government's \"hostile rhetoric\" towards teachers. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said Labour would would \"undo all of the hard work we've done to increase teachers' freedoms\". A Liberal Democrat spokesman said Labour might \"talk the talk\" on education, but there was little of substance in their promises. Speaking at the NASUWT union conference in Cardiff, Mr Hunt promised a \"new deal\" for teachers and a more teacher-friendly approach if Labour got into power after the general election. He accused the coalition government of deliberately trying to present the teaching profession in a \"negative light with the public\", directing \"deplorable, hostile, almost militaristic rhetoric towards the profession\". \"What possible justification can there ever be for a government to denigrate the contribution of public servants in this manner?\" said Mr Hunt. He told teachers that he would \"roll back the bureaucracy\" facing teachers and \"call time on the ceaseless 'initiative-itus', the constant tinkering with performance measures, curriculum, assessment criteria and school structures\". Mr Hunt said that teachers and profession-led bodies should have a more significant role in areas such as \"professional standards, quality assurance, curriculum development\". And he promised that Ofsted could adopt a more \"constructive, peer-review model of inspection led by outstanding heads and inspiring teachers\". Setting out the education priorities for Labour in the election campaign, he called for all teachers to have qualified teacher status or to be moving towards it and to allow local authorities to be able to open new schools \"on an equal footing with other providers\". He signalled that Labour would end the expansion of free schools and adopt a more strategically planned approach to creating new places for a rising population. Mr Hunt also promised support for childcare, early years services and a renewed effort to reduce child poverty. The National Union of Teachers conference in Harrogate is set to hear calls for a strike over pressures on school funding on Sunday. But Mr Hunt said: \"The cold truth is that there is no magic wand we can wave to take away the double squeeze of public finance and demographic pressures.\" The long-term challenge for England's school system, he argued, was how to ensure that it was robust enough to deliver the basics for all pupils, while allowing scope for the creativity and innovation needed for a 21st Century globalised economy. NASUWT leader Chris Keates welcomed Mr Hunt's speech and said the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were \"notable by their absence\" from the teachers' union conference. \"Poverty is poisoning the optimism of our youth and derailing and degrading the life chances of our children,\" she said, referring to his commitment to reduce child poverty. The NUT responded to Mr Hunt's speech by saying it welcomed the proposed changes to Ofsted, but the union \"looks forward to discussing with Labour how they will fund the increase in pupil numbers we are projecting\". But Mrs Morgan, education secretary and Conservative, said: \"We'll take no lessons from a party that let young people down and overwhelmed teachers with administrative burdens when they were in power. \"Trusting teachers is at the heart of our school reforms - we're giving them more control over what they teach and how they teach it. That's because we respect our teachers and recognise they know what's best for young people in their charge. \"As a result, we now have a million more children being taught in good or outstanding schools, 100,000 six-year-olds reading more confidently, and more children taking the core academic subjects that help them get on in life. \"Tristram Hunt and the Labour party would undo all of the hard work we've done to increase teachers' freedoms, raise standards in the classroom and restore faith in our qualifications.\" Responding to Mr Hunt's speech, a Liberal Democrat spokesman said: \"Labour may talk the talk but so far have done little more than insult teachers with proposals for a bureaucratic licensing system and a patronising Hippocratic oath. \"In government, Liberal Democrats have shown we trust teachers by giving the profession control of our \u00c2\u00a32.5bn pupil premium; backing a new Royal College of Teaching; axing Labour's hated A*-C league table measure, and successfully fighting to implement independent recommendations on pay. \"The overwhelming majority of teachers came into the profession for the right reasons and with high ambitions for children. We need to protect education budgets to ensure that the profession can continue to attract, reward and retain the very best people.\" UKIP's education spokesman Paul Nuttall said the only truth in Tristram Hunt's speech was about the \"shameful shortage of primary school places\". But Mr Nuttall said this was not a result of the free school policy, but \"mass uncontrolled immigration, brought in by Labour and supported by the Tories and Lib Dems\".", "question": "Labour 's Tristram Hunt says he wants to put \" trust back in the @placeholder \" between ministers and teachers .", "option_0": "past", "option_1": "game", "option_2": "relationship", "option_3": "family", "option_4": "world", "label": 2}
{"article": "\"Is it Hillary Clinton?\" Daniel Aston, 20, is puzzling over a picture of a woman who looms very large in the history of his home town. \"It's Margaret something,\" offers 19-year-old Andrew Jones. Only Liam Foster-Jones, of the three unemployed friends, seems certain about who the imperious features and swept-back helmet of hair might belong to. \"It's Margaret Thatcher,\" he says. The name doesn't seem to mean much to them. It would have been a different story 36 years ago, when the Thatcher government closed Consett's steel works, with the loss of 3,700 jobs. The devastation inflicted on this remote town high on the edge of the Pennines, where unemployment soared to 36%, made the national news and became a symbol of the harsh medicine the Thatcher government thought it had to administer to Britain's heavy industries. It sowed the seeds for the electoral wipe out the Conservatives would experience across large parts of Northern England and Scotland, which it still trying to recover from today. Thatcher and \"the Tories\" remain dirty words to the former steel workers in Consett but few young people I spoke to could recognise her and those that did regarded her as a distant historical figure. \"I don't really have an opinion [about her] but my dad doesn't like her because she shut down the steel works,\" said 20-year-old Adam Stokoe. \"So my dad has strong opinions about that. I'm not from that time period so I don't really think about it that way. I only think about now. What's going to benefit me.\" Consett has never had a Conservative MP but the Tory vote held up surprisingly well in other parts of the North-East while Thatcher was in power. In 1983, the party took 34% of North East votes, and had five MPs. It was only after she left office that anti-Tory attitudes really hardened, with the party's share of the vote slumping by 10%. It currently has just three MPs in the region. Theresa May is attempting to change that on 8 June and has urged traditional Labour supporters to \"lend\" her their vote. She will have experienced at first hand how difficult it is to break the voting habits of a lifetime in this part of the world when she stood for election in North West Durham in 1992. (By a strange coincidence, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron was also standing for Parliament for the first time that year in the same constituency.) They still remember Mrs May at Consett Working Men's Club - because, claims the barman, they wouldn't let her through the door. It had nothing to do with her politics, he adds, it's just that the club is one of a tiny handful left in the UK that does not admit women. \"Your wife can't chase you in here,\" says one regular, looking up from his racing form. He doesn't want to talk about politics. Mrs May won 28% of the vote in North West Durham - a score that has not been beaten by a Conservative candidate there since - but although one local poll put the party in with a chance of winning on 8 June it is not high on their target list. There was certainly little enthusiasm for Mrs May's brand of Conservatism in the town's Steel Club, although the lifelong Labour voters I spoke to were equally scathing about their traditional party of choice. \"I don't like Jeremy Corbyn. He hasn't got a brain in his head as far as I'm concerned,\" said Christopher Bell, a 69-year-old retired steel worker and club steward. He and his partner, Linda, voted for Brexit in last year's referendum and are worried about the strain they say is being placed on local services by East European immigrants. Linda, who voted UKIP in 2015, said she would not return to the Labour fold until the party was led by \"somebody that's going to stand up for English people, working class people - because the Conservatives like the rich and they like to keep them rich\". Thirty miles south in Darlington, a constituency with a narrower Labour majority of just over 3,000, people seemed more receptive to the Conservative message. The town has had a Tory MP before - Defence Secretary Michael Fallon in the 1980s - and the party has hopes of retaking the seat on 8 June. \"I will vote for Theresa May. Not necessarily because she's a Conservative but I think she's the only person for the job. Given the other options,\" says Alex Blackham, owner of a cafe in the town's indoor market. \"If she'd been Labour or an independent then I would have been voting for her as a person. I think that's what politics comes down to sometimes.\" Clive Hinson, a 59-year-old assembly line worker who was about to tuck into one of Mr Blackham's full English breakfasts, blames Thatcher for the closure of the dump truck factory he worked at in the 1980s. But he adds: \"Funnily enough, I'll be voting Conservative. Because I think Corbyn is a waste of time. \"He can't give a definitive answer on defence. He's got all these plans for spending loads of money but the figures just don't add up....so much though I don't want to vote Conservative that's the way I'm voting.\" He says the North East has \"forgiven but not forgotten\" Thatcher, comparing the reconciliation process to what happened in Northern Ireland or South Africa. Like Mr Blackham he voted for Brexit in last year's EU referendum. Most of the older working class people I spoke to - the traditional bedrock of Labour support in the area - needed no prompting to criticise what they saw as Jeremy Corbyn's lack of leadership ability and charisma. He seemed to go over much better with younger, more cosmopolitan voters. \"I would vote Corbyn all day every day,\" said Stephen Lock, who runs a comic book stall in the covered market with wife June. \"He's such a man of the people by the looks of it. He's looking after the general working people. He seems to have great ideas. They may be a little outdated in the modern day, but he's not the person they're painting him out to be. They are trying to make him out to be weak and I don't think he is.\" The couple returned from 13 years in France, where they had a gardening business, after the Brexit vote. \"We thought we had better come back and do something else here. It's affected us quite heavily,\" said Stephen. They are torn between voting Labour and Liberal Democrats - and are not impressed by what they see as the disloyalty of Labour MPs who openly criticise their leader. \"The Labour Party is shooting itself in the foot by not acting and standing as one,\" said June. \"You have got career politicians that are more concerned about their own personal interests than their constituents.\" There also appeared to real enthusiasm for Corbyn among Darlington's student population, who blame the media for portraying him in a negative light. \"You don't see a lot of coverage of, like, nice things about him,\" said 18-year-old Emily Frewin. \"But when you actually read into it he is a nice person.\" Theresa May avoids talking to the voters, she adds, but \"he seems like he wants to talk to everybody, not just the rich people\". \"He does seem to be getting slandered quite a lot,\" agrees 20-year-old software development student Josh Walker, \"when he's trying to fight for us.\" If the Thatcher factor was ever a major impediment to a Tory revival in the North East, it has undoubtedly faded with time. The party's tactic of detaching Theresa May's name - it was emblazoned across the battle bus she toured the North-East in - from the Conservative brand appears to be working with some voters, who might feel a little queasy at the prospect of putting their cross next to a Tory candidate. Some told me they had flirted with a Conservative vote, only to think better of it - Mrs May's support for a free vote on fox hunting, not an issue that has exactly dominated the airwaves, was mentioned by several people as a reason for not switching to the Tories. And there will always be some who will never forget, or forgive. Like the Darlington woman who greeted Theresa May's name with a horrified cry of \"she's another Maggie Thatcher!\". But on the basis of this highly unscientific sample, Thatcher is no longer the bogey figure she was and Labour can no longer rely on the loyalty of its traditional support base.", "question": "The Conservatives are hoping to win back seats in the North - East of England on 8 June - has the party finally escaped the @placeholder of Margaret Thatcher which helped make much of the region a no - go area for them ?", "option_0": "presidency", "option_1": "freedom", "option_2": "state", "option_3": "effects", "option_4": "shadow", "label": 4}

Lucy Peng, a senior executive at e-commerce giant Alibaba, and Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, are the highest-ranked. Also on the list are Pollyanna Chu, chief executive of Hong Kong financial services firm Kingston Securities, and China's first lady, Peng Liyuan. The survey features 100 women from 29 countries who represent sectors such as politics, business, technology and philanthropy. Forbes said the women on the list control $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3694bn) in revenue and influence more than 3.6bn people around the world. There are 32 chief executives on the list, 12 world leaders and 11 billionaires, including nine who have built billion-dollar companies from scratch. The average age is 57, with Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer the youngest at 41 and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II the oldest at 90. The number of UK women who made the rankings doubled to six. Besides Queen Elizabeth, they include Nemat Shafik, deputy governor of the Bank of England, and Katharine Viner, editor of the Guardian. The newcomers are Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor of the Economist, and Eliza Manningham-Buller, chair of the Wellcome Trust. This is the sixth consecutive year Mrs Merkel has topped the list and the tenth time in total. Moira Forbes, president and publisher of Forbes Woman, said it was \"extraordinary\" that Mrs Merkel had been able to maintain power for so long. \"She's not only the head of the fourth largest economy in the world but she's defied existential political and economic challenges to the EU, for example trying to ensure that countries like Greece and Spain adhere to the fiscal logic she espouses,\" she told BBC News. \"She's also dealing with EU crises such as immigration...She's someone whose power extends far beyond traditional borders.\" Ms Forbes noted that nearly half of the women on this year's list were from outside the US, while a quarter were from the Asia-Pacific region, the highest number since the survey's inception. \"These are positive trends as women are ascending more into positions of traditional business corporate power but also political power,\" she said. Among the most high-profile drop-offs is Dilma Rousseff, the former president of Brazil, who was impeached in May over allegations of violating fiscal rules, which she denies. Elizabeth Holmes, founder of the blood-testing firm Theranos, also failed to make the list. US federal agencies are investigating Theranos over allegations its tests are inaccurate.

Just to show there are no hard feelings, Mr Corbyn has drafted him back into his frontbench team as shadow Northern Ireland secretary. Then:  On Mr Corbyn's assertion the Tories were in retreat, Mr Smith told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg in September last year: \"I think that's delusional. I think Jeremy needs to think a bit more about that straight, honest politics that he started his campaign with. The straight, honest truth is that we are right now at our lowest ebb in the polls, ever. If there was an election tomorrow Labour would be decimated, and that's got to be a shock to Labour's system.\" Now: \"I was clearly wrong in feeling Jeremy wouldn't be able to do this well and I think he has proved me wrong, and lots of people wrong, I take my hat off to him.... I don't know what Jeremy's got, but if we could bottle it and drink it we'd all be doing very well.\" Hilary Benn, who was sacked from Labour's frontbench by Mr Corbyn, following reports he was trying to organise a coup against the leader, has also been fulsome in his praise for Mr Corbyn's campaign. Then: \"He is a good and decent man, but he is not a leader.\" Now: \"I think he fought a brilliant campaign, which enthused a lot of people with a message of hope over the politics of fear,\" Mr Benn told the BBC's Newsnight programme. Labour's former deputy leader cheerfully admits she got it wrong about Mr Corbyn, replying \"delicious\" when Lord Prescott's son David tweeted a picture of a pie with the word \"humble\". Then: \"If you fail, you can't take the party down with you - that's not fair,\" Ms Harman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme in July last year, after a vote of no confidence in the Labour leader. Now: \"The atmosphere is verging from on one hand relief to jubilant, and the Tories are in disarray. And Jeremy Corbyn has to take the credit for that, because he was the leader and he's gone forward,\" she told the same programme after the election. John Woodcock disowned Jeremy Corbyn at the start of the election campaign - telling his constituents to vote for him rather than the Labour leader.

It's like - what's it called? - Monty Python, where he's like, 'It's only a flesh wound!'

On Tuesday, scores of protesters packed a sometimes heated council meeting.

The Chesterton development, on land owned by Lord Bathurst, would see up to 2,350 homes, as well as businesses, a primary school and a GP surgery built south of Chesterton. An outline planning application has been submitted to Cotswold District Council. Protest group Save Our Cirencester say it effectively means another town being \"bolted on to the side of Cirencester\". The town is the main centre of the Cotswolds with a population of about 20,000. Mr Phillips told BBC Gloucestershire: \"We've done a lot of work to make sure that what it definitely won't be is a soulless housing estate.\" He said he believed Cirencester was the \"best place\" to take a \"significant proportion\" of the 7,500 homes planned across the Cotswolds District Council area up to 2031.

Mr Asif was studying architecture at a university in Melbourne when he was diagnosed with terminal skin cancer in July. His case attracted wide media attention after he made an emotional plea to see his family before died. Mr Dutton's office told the BBC he received a call on Wednesday afternoon confirming the decision to grant Mr Asif's mother and brother a visa. Mr Asif told Network Ten on Tuesday night that it was difficult to face the prospect of death without his family around him and questioned why they had been denied visas. \"I'm dying and it's really hard because of the pain. In these circumstances everybody would like to be with family,\" he said. At an earlier press conference, Mr Dutton said that in such cases immigration officials would have considered several factors before granting or denying visas, including the likelihood applicants might overstay their visa or make a claim for protection. \"In some cases that can result in millions of dollars of expense to the taxpayer,\" he said. \"It may mean that somebody is here on welfare for an extended period of time so the consideration has to be in the national interest.\" The Melbourne City Mission homelessness centre has been caring for Mr Asif, who was previously living in a squat. The centre's director, Sheridan Bruinhout, said Mr Asif had a relatively small social network because his focus had been on studying.

Present owner Ann Budge had proposed delaying the repayment of her \u00a32.5m investment to help fund the project. Following a vote of foundation members, only 43 were against the proposal and 3,790 in favour. Hearts said on their website: \"We are absolutely delighted that the foundation members have given such a resounding vote in favour of the offer from Ann Budge. \"This significant milestone on the road to the 'new' Tynecastle once more demonstrates our collective strength.\" Hearts hope to fund the new stand via \u00a33m from club reserves, \u00a32.5m from benefactor contributions, \u00a30.5m from commercial contributions, which leaves a shortfall of \u00a36m once the club adds a contingency for an increase in costs.

{"article": "BBC Radio 5 live has taken an in-depth look at the history of the genre in a special programme called the Beautiful Gamers, which you can watch on the BBC Sport website at 19:30 GMT on Thursday. And to mark the occasion, we've picked our eight most important football video games of all time. John O'Shea, the curator of a football video game exhibition at the National Football Museum called Pitch to Pixel, has told us why each game was so significant. Think we've missed one out? Tell us by joining in the debate on our Sportsday page. The Intellivision system looked more like an air conditioning unit than a home computer console - and it was a fetching beige colour too. Released in the same year Trevor Francis made his British record \u00a31m transfer from Birmingham City to Nottingham Forest, Intellivision Soccer (also known as NASL Soccer) is considered the first football video game. And yes, it was just matchstick men marching around a pitch, but who knows what would have happened without it? John O'Shea: \"At the time the marketing slogan for Intellivision was 'the closest thing to the real thing'. And it basically was. It's very playable but it didn't become a huge success.\" This game for the Atari 2600 was as simple as Pele himself was magnificent. You controlled a formation of three dots, each one representing a player, and tried to shuffle the ball into the goal. It showed the power of getting a big name on your product, and also spawned an advert featuring Trevor Brooking with Morecambe and Wise. John O'Shea: \"Atari were a totally new type of company. They were the first real computer games company coming out of Silicon Valley and they got Pele on board, who was this charismatic football star. They knew the hardware couldn't reflect what you see on TV, so they took this simple triangle formation and it's a game not unlike 'Pong'. It was very playable and popular and was the first success story.\" In all honesty, this game was slightly bonkers. There were no rules, so you could use your-muscle bound player to flatten your opponents. A great laugh when you were playing against a mate. There's an argument that it's more a 'beat 'em up' than a football game. Regardless, anyone who had a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) probably gave this game a whirl at some point. John O'Shea: \"In the 1980s there were the Spectrums and Commodore 64s and this home computer revolution. But it was really the NES that brought the game play to the next level. It's a very peculiar game and is a lot of fun. It's not at all realistic, the players look like wrestlers, there were no fouls and it's graphically very strange. But it really did sow a seed that a computer game based on football could be very successful.\" Want to see a middle-aged football-game fanatic cry a tear of nostalgia? Ask them about Sensible Soccer - or Sensi, as it is affectionately known. Mainly found on the Commodore Amiga system, it captured the hearts of a generation and is a cult classic. The sequel Sensible World of Soccer was named one of the 10 most important games of all time by a panel of experts in 2007. John O'Shea: \"Sensible Soccer is rightly regarded as not just a brilliant football game but as one of the greatest games of all time. The first version came out in 1992 but it really got into its stride in 1994 when it basically had all the leagues and clubs. It looked cool with a pixelated appearance from above and was very playable because it was so fast. The designer Jon Hare integrated the two aspects we think about with games now - the live action but also the management aspect.\" \"Sensible Soccer was a phenomenon. When I was a kid I played Subbuteo - Sensible Soccer was my fantasy of electric Subbuteo that I could play without my dad being there. \"I think Sensible World of Soccer was one of the most pirated games ever. Every 10 of 11 copies in the UK were pirated and I've yet to meet anyone from Poland or the Netherlands who bought the game. But we still made a load of money. \"I knew Sensible Soccer, more than any other game, would be massive. You knew it was something special. It was like magic. \"We're going to try and rekindle that by making Sociable Soccer. It's in the spirit of Sensible Soccer - the playability is similar. You pick the team you support - I'd say Norwich - and you join a fantasy clan. All the other Norwich fans are playing for Norwich as well and the table is sorted by average points scored.\" Can you imagine a game where you arrange contracts, plan training sessions and assign squad numbers? You've just imagined one of the most successful and enduring football games of all time. Created in 1992 by brothers Paul and Oliver Collyer, Championship Manager, the predecessor to Football Manager, is a stupendously addictive manager simulator that has even been cited in divorce cases. John O'Shea: \"There was a sense in the gaming industry that live action was the way to go and the management stuff could be dumped. The creators of Championship Manager approached EA (Electronic Arts) about publishing their game and they were rejected. But they stuck to their guns. It's a game for the fans, for anyone who thinks they could manage a team better than the real manager.\" What a monster the Fifa series of games has become. Its beginnings were humble with Fifa International Soccer - it had a bug where you could score by standing right in front of the keeper when he kicked the ball out of his hands. An amazing way to wind up your mates. It has morphed year after year into the slick, crisp, realistic game you see today. John O'Shea: \"EA were producing some brilliant sports games. When they went into the soccer arena they did change how football games looked. They had this isometric view point and the game felt more like it looked on TV.  They also had the licensing agreement with Fifa and have held that title every year.\" Now it's all face scanning and motion capturing and movie-style graphics. The latest Fifa release is light years from the first offering 23 years ago. It started life as ISS Pro in the 1990s, but in the early 2000s Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer series blew a big raspberry at the stranglehold Fifa held on the football game market. It didn't have big-money licenses, so there were made up names (Aston Villa as West Midlands Village, anyone?), but playing PES was the equivalent of liking an obscure band. Did it make you a video game snob? Probably. Were you a better human being for playing it? Definitely. If hipsters were a thing at the time, they would have played Pro. In recent years Fifa has re-established itself as the market leader, but Pro Evo is still in there fighting. John O'Shea: \"What ISS and Pro Evo did - particularly in the mid-2000s - was bring a level of fun and playability to the game that maybe had gone off the boil with Fifa. Pro Evo was the game for the connoisseur of football games and it's still a brilliant game.\" Pro Evo, which is part developed in Windsor in England, has played its part in the technological race.

{"article": "Xavier Bertrand said 9,000 migrants, many trying to get to the UK, were in a Calais camp known as the Jungle.

{"article": "In November last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned the country by announcing that 500 ($7.47; \u00c2\u00a35.96) and 1,000 rupee notes were as good as garbage. Despite his insistence that the ban was meant to curb black money and put terrorists out of business, many analysts said it was motivated by politics rather than economics, and done with an eye on the Uttar Pradesh - or UP - elections. Since the rise of the regional Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the late 1990s, India's national parties - the Congress and Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - have been often relegated to third and fourth positions in the state. This time around, the Congress has joined the governing SP as a junior partner in an alliance, and the BJP is making an all out effort to win back the state. In the past few days, I've travelled through several districts in the state to ask people if the currency ban - called demonetisation by Indian authorities and economists, and simply \"notebandi\" (Hindi for stopping of notes) here - is an election issue. The Indian election no-one can afford to lose The \"notebandi\" has without doubt touched every life, in the big cities, smaller towns, and tiny villages, and everyone talks about the problems they've faced. But will it impact the way people vote? In the main market in Barabanki town, not far from the state capital, Lucknow, the trading community is seething at the \"BJP's betrayal\". Traders have traditionally supported the BJP, and in the past they have also contributed generously to party funds. But this time, they tell me they will not vote for the party. \"Notebandi is the biggest issue here,\" says Santosh Kumar Gupta, who along with his brothers runs the family hardware store. \"The public has been really hassled. The government set limits on withdrawals and even those little amounts were unavailable because banks had no money.\" Mr Gupta points out that in his address to the nation, the prime minister said the government had been planning for it for six months and that people would face minor problems. \"But there were lots of problems. Isn't he ashamed of lying?\" he asks angrily. \"Police used sticks to beat up people waiting in queues to withdraw their own hard-earned money. All small manufacturing units in Barabanki shut down for weeks. Thousands became unemployed. \"There's a labour market a few metres from our shop and every morning, nearly 500 daily wage labourers from the nearby villages would gather to look for work, but for the first time, we saw there were no takers for them.\" His brother Manoj Kumar Jaiswal adds: \"Traders are very angry with Mr Modi. He first said it was done to curb black money. Then he said it was done to promote digital economy. \"You can use credit cards and (popular mobile wallet) Paytm in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, not in Barabanki. People here are illiterate, many people don't have bank accounts or credit cards.\" The Gupta family has 10 voters and not one will opt for the BJP. In Gosaiganj, on the outskirts of Lucknow, I stop to talk to people gathered at a tea stall. Raja Ram Rawat, a 60-year-old widower, lives with his two sons and four grandchildren. The small plot of land he owns is not sufficient to support the family and his sons work as daily wagers to supplement the family income. \"Since 8 November, they've not been able to find work even for one day,\" he says. I ask him how they are managing. \"Earlier if we bought two kilograms of vegetables, now we buy only one. That's how we are managing.\" A farmer in the group, Kallu Prasad, compares the ban to \"poison\" for his community - it came just as the rice crop had been harvested and the sowing season had begun for wheat, mustard and potatoes. \"Normally we sell a kilo of rice for 14 rupees, but this time we had to sell it for eight or nine rupees. We couldn't buy seeds and pesticides in time. Farmers who grew vegetables were the worst affected. Since people had no money to buy vegetables, they had to just throw them away.\" In the holy city of Varanasi, walking through the narrow lanes of Lallapura area, where homes sit cheek by jowl, one cannot escape the noise of looms. Here, every home is a tiny factory where weavers work in semi-darkened rooms, using coloured silk threads to create beautiful patterns. Varanasi is famous for its hand woven silk and cotton saris and nearly a million people make their living from this cottage industry here. \"It was like we were hit by a bolt of lightning,\" says factory owner Sardar Mohd Hasim, describing the moment of Mr Modi's announcement. Mr Hasim, who represents 30,000 weavers, says initially \"about 90% of the industry\" was affected since all their transactions happen in cash. \"We had no cash to buy raw materials, we had no cash to pay wages to the workers. Nearly three months later, all my 24 looms are still shut. Most of my weavers are doing other jobs to earn a living.\" Varanasi has eight constituencies, and Mr Hasim insists that BJP will not win even one. \"Why would anyone now vote for Modi?\" he asks. One of his former workers, 40-year-old Mangru Prajapati, who is now back to work in Mr Hasim's brother's loom, agrees. He's the sole breadwinner for his family of eight - his wife, four children and elderly parents. \"Earlier I would work six days a week. Now I consider myself lucky if I can find work even two or three days in a week. Survival has become very difficult.\" Rajan Behal, trader and leader of the organisation that represents traders, weavers and sellers, calls it a \"major disaster\". The ban, he says, couldn't have come at a worse time - November to February is the wedding season when sales peak, but this year it's been a wipe-out. The industry's annual turnover is estimated to be about 70bn rupees ($1bn; \u00c2\u00a3835m) and the loss is estimated to be around 10bn rupees. A long-time BJP supporter, Mr Behal refuses to say who he will vote for but predicts that Mr Modi \"will not win enough seats to be able to form a government in the state\". It's an assessment challenged by senior BJP leader in the state Vijay Pathak, who pegs the party's chances of winning at \"101%\". He says that there were difficulties in the implementation of the currency ban, but insists that they have been able to convince the voters that it was done in the nation's interest. \"We started our campaign with the aim to win more than 265 of the 403 seats. Now we believe we will cross 300.\" That, he says, is because people have faith in \"the man who's taking the decisions\"  - the prime minister. On this count, he's right - Mr Modi's personal stock remains high, especially with the youth. In Kukha Rampur village in Tiloi constituency in Amethi district, 21-year-old Tanu Maurya says she will vote for Mr Modi because he is \"doing good work\" and that the note ban was \"a good decision even if it caused some hardships in the short term\". Someone else voting for Mr Modi is Pramila Chaurasia, 19, the newest bride in the neighbouring Bhulaiya Purva village - as will most of her family and fellow villagers. Since his sweep of the 2014 general election, Mr Modi has not had much luck in state elections and he's desperate to reverse that losing trend. A victory in the politically key state of Uttar Pradesh would be a huge shot in the arm for Mr Modi and his party. But will the rupee ban help him or hurt his chances?

{"article": "But the battle for second place seems to be hotting up, with opinion polls suggesting that Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives are currently neck and neck. Here, John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University and the chief commentator at whatscotlandthinks.org.uk, looks at what the polls have been saying, and what we should be reading into them. One of the first rules in the reporting of opinion polls is that those that purport to show a change in who is ahead and who is behind secure much more publicity than do those that suggest that little, if anything has changed. The exceptional is more interesting than the mundane. However, the exceptional may be just that - unrepresentative of the real picture, a \"rogue\" poll that misleads rather than informs. So what should we make of the poll from YouGov in Thursday's edition of the Times that has been widely reported as showing that the Conservatives have, for the first time since the creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, overtaken Labour in voting intentions for this coming May's Holyrood election? Such an outcome would constitute an earthquake in Scottish politics. Not since 1959 have the Tories managed to outpoll Labour in a national election north of the border. Well, first of all, the YouGov poll does not constitute clear evidence that the Tories have overtaken Labour. True, with 20% of the vote to Labour's 19%, the party is put slightly ahead in the battle for constituency votes. But given the random variation to which all polls are subject, this statistically is simply a dead heat. We just cannot be sure which of the two parties is ahead. Meanwhile on the second of the two votes that voters will be invited to cast in May, that is, for a regional list, the poll did actually put the two parties neck and neck in 20% each. At the same time, no other poll has suggested the two parties are even equal with each other. Perhaps then it is but no more than a \"rogue\". That said, YouGov is not alone in one respect. In recent weeks every single poll has identified a modest but noticeable increase in Conservative support. Since the beginning of the year four companies have conducted polls of vote intentions for May's election. On average they have put the Conservatives on 17.5% (on both ballots). But when those same four companies polled back at the beginning of September they credited the Conservatives on average with just over 14%. While the result of one poll might be dismissed as an aberration, when four polls all point in the same direction we can be pretty sure that something really has happened. Meanwhile, Labour's support, already much diminished, has ebbed away yet further over the same period. Back in September Labour was averaging between 21% and 22%. Now the party stands between 19% and 20%. The party has apparently slipped by another couple of points. Between them the three point increase in Conservative support and a two point drop in Labour is enough to ensure that all the polls agree that the Conservatives are now breathing down Labour's neck, even if they may not necessarily as yet caught them up. But there are of course still three months to go to polling day. Perhaps the slow Tory advance will continue, in which case maybe they will be able to edge past Labour. But equally, of course, Labour might recover - and avert the threat that Ruth Davidson's party currently apparently poses.

{"article": "The crushing of the rebel enclave in eastern Aleppo  represents a major propaganda victory for the government of President Bashar al-Assad, which now controls virtually all of the major population centres of the country. Aleppo though - the most populous city before the civil war and the country's financial centre - is the biggest prize. The capture of Aleppo represents a victory not just for Mr Assad but also for his Iranian and Russian backers. Aleppo itself may not matter much on Moscow's strategic chess-board. But the defeat of the rebel opposition there underscores the extraordinary turn-around in President Assad's fortunes. Before Russia intervened President Assad was on the ropes; his military power crumbling. External actors have propped up his government in large part to secure their own strategic aspirations. And these aspirations will play an important part in deciding what comes next. If the government can consolidate its hold on Aleppo, then it now controls a significant part of what might be termed \"essential Syria\" - the west of the country, its major cities and the Mediterranean coastline. One option would be for the Assad government to dig in and consolidate this \"rump\" Syria. Mr Assad himself, of course, has always insisted that his troops will remain on the offensive until all the territory held by the rebels is recaptured. This though may be nothing more than bravado. His army is overstretched and a shadow of the force with which he began this conflict. Indeed, as the ejection of its forces from Palmyra by the return of so-called Islamic State (IS) shows, the Assad government may be hard put to hang on to many of its gains. It is fundamentally weak and its success in Aleppo should not obscure this essential fact. Much of the regular Syrian army has disintegrated into a variety of loyalist militias, often with local or regional concerns. And much of the fighting has been spearheaded by Iranian-backed forces - Hezbollah from Lebanon and various other Shia Muslim militias. Many rebel fighters may have escaped the city to seek refuge in Idlib province, to the south-west of Aleppo. This could well be the next major battleground, if the government and its Russian backers want to maintain the momentum. Russia's view will be of critical importance. It cannot necessarily tell Mr Assad what to do, but it can certainly influence the means at his disposal - weaponry and air power. What will Moscow want to do next? Is it in its interest to see perpetual war in the region? Or might it seek to draw a line with the fall of Aleppo and seek some kind of arrangement or understanding with the incoming Trump administration in Washington? Any such deal of course would mean the US accepting Iran's growing significance in Syria. The Russian-leaning sentiments of some in the incoming US administration would be thrown into stark opposition to the strident hostility to Iran shown by many of Mr Trump's picks for the key security and defence jobs. But Washington's options are becoming limited. The fall of Aleppo places another nail in the coffin of the Obama administration's strategy of aiding the so-called moderate opposition. Of course Washington wants the moderate rebels to fight IS, but now they are likely to be under even greater pressure from government forces. The anti-Assad rebels now face a very difficult time. They have lost more than just a battle. They may not have lost the war - or at least not yet - but they are even further away from winning it. Their relationship with the incoming US administration is uncertain. Nobody knows what Mr Trump may do. Many analysts fear that moderate rebel groups will be pushed inexorably into the embrace of the more extreme Islamist factions. But beyond the geo-politics and the military campaigns, there is the devastating human tragedy of what has befallen the city. Once the fighting is over, the true scale of the calamity will be revealed. Aleppo - like many other places in Syria - needs massive and rapid assistance. In the longer term, there needs to be an epic battle to rebuild and reconstruct. But with the fighting continuing elsewhere and with so many people killed, maimed and displaced, a heavily-sanctioned Syria has neither the financial nor the human capital for such a task. In the wake of Aleppo's fall, all of the actors - both internal and external - are going to have to reassess their strategies.

{"article": "Hamilton, trailing Vettel by 25 points in the championship, was 0.198seconds clear of the German with their team-mates Valtteri Bottas and Kimi Raikkonen next. Fernando Alonso's return to Formula 1 after missing the Monaco Grand Prix ended with the Spaniard stopping on track. The two-time champion suffered a lack of hydraulic pressure, McLaren said. The team were unable to say what had caused the problem. Alonso was told by his engineer to stop on track. He pointed out that was he already at the hairpin, the last corner before the pit entry and it was easier to come back to the pits, but was ordered to stop. He flung the impact-protection foam out of his cockpit as he climbed out and was given a standing ovation and cheers by the crowd in the grandstands. \"We are used to it,\" he told reporters on the way back to the pits. The failure came as McLaren executive director Zak Brown again said that Honda had to up their game if the partnership was to have a future. Two days after saying he had \"serious concerns\" about Honda, and a day after Alonso indicated he could leave McLaren at the end of the year if they were not winning by September, Brown told BBC Sport: \"The plan right now is to have the Honda in the back of the car (in 2018) but some things need to happen between now and then for us to have the confidence we can be at the front of the field next year. \"We need to get competitive and show regular signs that we are getting competitive. \"Right now, we're not racing well, not finishing races and that can't happen any more. \"We are starting to work on the 2018 car so we need to make any decisions that impact 2018 by the summer break.

You can't keep doing the same thing and expect things to change.\" Asked if they had been discussing a customer engine supply with Mercedes, Brown said: \"We have a plan B, a Plan C. We have some plans.\" Back at the front, it was for Mercedes an encouraging start to a weekend when ideally they need to start clawing back some ground in the championship.

{"article": "For a country where powerful army generals overthrew civilian leaders on at least three different occasions, Mr Musharraf's trial is unprecedented. It's the first time a former army chief is being held accountable for his alleged constitutional violations. Mr Musharraf denies the charges - if he is convicted he faces death or life imprisonment, the punishments for high treason in Pakistan. For pro-democracy activists, the indictment is as much about fighting the last military dictator, as it is about preventing any future military takeovers. But some believe that this is as far as it might go. Since Pervez Musharraf's return to Pakistan in March 2013, he has faced four criminal cases but was bailed in all of them. He was charged: His most serious challenge is a treason case, which bears five charges including suspending the constitution and imposing emergency rule. He has pleaded not guilty but could face death if convicted. Few believe the trial will actually lead to his conviction. The main reason, it would seem, is the support Mr Musharraf still seemingly enjoys in his parent institution, the armed forces. Conventional wisdom in Pakistan suggests the army would not allow their former chief to be disgraced in that manner. Analysts believe that over the years, Pakistan's powerful generals have conceded some space to the country's increasingly assertive democratic institutions, but there are limits to it. Mr Musharraf's rival, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, will be aware of not crossing any red lines. He needs his army chief on his side in helping run the country, tackling the Taliban threat and managing ties with India and Afghanistan. For his part, Mr Musharraf is now keen to get out of Pakistan. His team has asked the government to remove a travel ban to allow him to visit his elderly mother who is in hospital in the United Arab Emirates and to seek his own medical treatment abroad. As the prime minister, Mr Sharif could make that call on humanitarian grounds. It would allow him to take the high moral ground as a reformed statesman, not a vindictive politician interested in getting even with his once handpicked army chief who then overthrew his elected government and put him jail on terrorism charges. General Musharraf later allowed Mr Sharif and his family to go into exile in Saudi Arabia. Cabinet ministers insist that the government's treatment of Mr Musharraf is not about the bitter rivalry between him and Mr Sharif. But in a strange twist of fate, it is now up to the latter whether or not to allow his erstwhile nemesis to leave the country. Then, as now, the quiet, behind-the-scenes role of Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies is seen as the key to any arrangement that effectively allows Mr Musharraf to go into exile. But what if Mr Sharif is not ready to let Mr Musharraf off the hook so easily? Since his return from self-imposed exile in March 2013, the former president has faced a host of criminal and murder charges. The manner in which the government and the courts pursued one case after another gave credibility to claims by Mr Musharraf that he was being politically victimised. In late 2013, just as it was becoming clear that he would be granted bail in the last of those cases, came the government announcement that a special court would be constituted to try him for high treason. For the last three months or so, Mr Musharraf has avoided facing the court, citing security concerns and ill health. Now that the charges have been framed, some worry that the trial could drag on for months, if not years. Others point to the complex nature of the trial in trying to fix responsibility for alleged constitutional violations on one man. Mr Musharraf's team has maintained that he did not act alone in imposing emergency rule. A former Musharraf aide warns the trial would open up a Pandora's box. According to him, it would inevitably involve dragging several senior members of his government, as well as serving and retired military officials, into the case. His team says the former military president acted on the advice of the then prime minister and in consultation with his senior aides, who are said to have backed his controversial steps.", "question": "The indictment of Pakistan 's former military president , Pervez Musharraf , on charges of treason is being seen as a milestone on the way to becoming a @placeholder democracy .", "option_0": "couple", "option_1": "growing", "option_2": "functioning", "option_3": "beach", "option_4": "drug", "label": 2}

Labour rejects claims of \"hard left\" and Conservative supporters signing up to back left winger Jeremy Corbyn. And a Labour spokeswoman rejected calls to suspend the leadership contest. She said said there was a \"very robust\" system in place to prevent fraudulent and malicious applications and additional checks are being carried out to make sure the rules are upheld. An exclusion list is being drawn up of those who have stood against Labour in the past or had helped others to oppose the party. The BBC understands that up to 1,000 applications have been rejected. One of Mr Corbyn's backers called Mr Sheerman's suggestion \"ridiculous\". Backbench MP Diane Abbott said it was coming from people \"who think their side will lose\". She added: \"This election is being fought under rules that were agreed by the whole party last year.\" Under the new rules, introduced by previous leader Ed Miliband, people can sign up as registered supporters for \u00c2\u00a33 and take part in the vote. They are asked to confirm they \"support the aims and values of the Labour Party\". The popularity of Mr Corbyn's campaign has sparked warnings from the other candidates, Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall, about the party moving to the left. Mr Sheerman's comments follow similar sentiments from two backbench MPs, Graham Stringer and John Mann, who called for the leadership contest to be halted. The Huddersfield MP and former select committee chairman, first elected in 1979, told the BBC there were large numbers of people joining Labour to vote for the new leader and some of their reasons were \"malign\". Labour MPs were \"dumbfounded\" when they learned how the contest was to be run and the process was now in \"real trouble\", he said. At-a-glance profiles of the four contenders Labour's acting leader Harriet Harman has emailed the party's MPs with a list of new members in their constituencies asking them to pick out any suspicious names. Mr Sheerman said although he may be able to pick up some \"usual suspects\", many others would not be detected. He denied his concerns were in any way motivated by his support for Liz Kendall, saying he had fought against \"entryism\" before and believed the current process was flawed. Labour says the verification process is ongoing, and that ballot papers have not yet been sent out. Labour recently rejected an application from Conservative MP Tim Loughton, who said he tried to become a registered supporter to highlight flaws in the system. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's the World at One, Ms Kendall said it was \"great\" that more people were signing up to Labour and said she had not seen anything that concerned her. \"The important thing is that the checks are put in place,\" she added.

Labour's former communications director, Alastair Campbell, said the party \"could be finished\" if Mr Corbyn wins.

{"article": "In Scotland, death rates for breast cancer have fallen by 33%, bowel cancer by 30%, lung cancer by 23% and prostate cancer by 11%. The figures come as the charity launches a new marketing campaign called We Will Beat Cancer Sooner. It calls on everyone across Scotland to join the fight against the disease now. Lung, breast, bowel and prostate cancers together account for almost half of all cancer deaths in the UK every year. Cancer Research UK said breast cancer scientists had been responsible for improving detection through screening, developing more specialist care and more effective treatments such as improved surgery, radiotherapy and drugs. In Scotland, about 1,300 people died of the disease per year 20 years ago, compared with 1,000 every year now. The charity said research had also meant fewer bowel cancer patients were dying thanks to improved early detection and the development of better treatments. Today almost 200 fewer Scots a year die from bowel cancer than 20 years ago. Cancer Research UK said there had been little improvement in the outlook for those diagnosed with lung cancer, so it had made it a priority to stem lung cancer mortality through earlier diagnosis and trials for improved treatments. Improvements in treatment - including surgery, hormone therapy, and radiotherapy - as well as earlier diagnosis, are thought to have contributed to the trend of reduced prostate cancer death rates. But not all cancer death rates have dropped. Mortality rates in liver, pancreatic, melanoma, oral and some digestive cancers have all increased. Lisa Adams, Cancer Research UK's spokeswoman for Scotland, said: \"The latest figures highlight the good news, that research continues to save lives from cancer and offer hope that this progress will continue. \"But while the death rate for the four biggest cancer killers falls, it's vital to remember that we need to do more to help bring even better results over the coming years. \"There are more than 200 different forms of the disease.

{"article": "In his first broadcast interview, Kweku Adoboli told the BBC that banking was still riven by conflicts of interest. He added that traders were pushed to make profits \"no matter what\". Asked if the crimes he committed - booking fictitious trades to cover up gambles in the hunt for profits - could happen again, he said: \"Absolutely\". Adoboli - the biggest rogue trader in British history and described by the prosecution at his trial as a \"master fraudster\" and \"sophisticated liar\" - now faces deportation to Ghana, where he was born. He said he is fighting the order as he is as \"British in culture\" as anyone living in the UK and could help the finance sector to reform by sharing his experiences. After coming out of prison a year ago, 36-year-old Adoboli, who has lived in Britain since he was 12, said he had been prevented from taking paid work. He is living with friends in Edinburgh and speaks for free at banking compliance conferences. I asked him if behaviour in banking had changed since he was found guilty in 2012 of two counts of fraud and sentenced to seven years in prison. \"No, certainly not,\" he answered. \"I think the young people I've spoken to, former colleagues I have spoken to, are still struggling with the same issues, the same conflicts, the same pressures to achieve no matter what. \"And this goes back to the structure of the industry. People are required to take risk to generate profit, because yields in the industry are consistently compressed. \"And if investment banks continue to chase the same level of profitability as they have in the past, the only way to generate those profits is to take more risk. \"But from a politics angle, the desire is to limit that risk taking, to limit the profitability, but you have these conflicted goals. \"And where the conflict comes is where people fall into this grey zone, and so I think it can absolutely happen again. \"Especially as we go into what could be the next phase of the great financial crisis over the next 12 to 24 months.\" Adoboli said that he was sorry for his actions, which at one stage had the potential to undermine the whole operation of UBS after his possible losses rose to over \u00a38bn ($10.6bn). His actions included setting up secret internal slush funds and booking fictitious deals to hide the amount of risk he was taking. Multi-million pound bets on movements in the stock markets also failed to come off. He claimed others at the bank knew of his actions and he was put under enormous pressure to make high levels of profit. UBS has denied that anyone else knew what Adoboli was doing and no charges have been brought against any other UBS traders. A number testified in court that Adoboli had been operating alone.

Both bridges would be returned to public ownership once construction and maintenance costs had been recovered from the collection of tolls. Mr Davies had written to the Department for Transport on behalf of a constituent, seeking confirmation of the date of transfer. Mr Norman replied saying: \"I am pleased to confirm that the bridges will revert to public ownership on 8 January 2018 and that all tolls will end at the Severn Crossings by the 31 December 2018.\" The Monmouth MP said: \"I'm very pleased with it - it's the confirmation everyone had been expecting and not some wild manifesto promise. \"It's going to be carried out in the timescale promised.\" Mr Davies said he understood there were some unexpected additional maintenance costs to be covered which meant that the tolls would not be lifted immediately.

{"article": "On Thursday, Root himself said he was looking forward to the time when his leadership mettle would be examined. On the first day of the second Test, where South Africa moved on to 309-6, Root got his wish and, in turn, allowed the pressure to ease off the Proteas on more than one occasion. It was a fluctuating day - South Africa were attritional in the first session, fluent after lunch and had to recover following a four-wicket collapse in the evening. They were helped by England opting to use Liam Dawson ahead of fellow spinner Moeen Ali and again in the sleepy overs in the run-up to the second new ball. I'm not the only one confused by England's approach to Moeen, with both Root and coach Trevor Bayliss saying that he is now seen as the second spinner. When confidence is high - as Moeen's should be after taking 10 wickets at Lord's - it is reasonable to expect players to perform for you. Therefore, I was surprised when left-armer Dawson, despite what the England higher-ups are saying about his place in the pecking order, was used before Moeen at Trent Bridge. Media playback is not supported on this device Put simply, we know that Moeen is good enough at this level, but the same cannot yet be said about Dawson, who is playing in only his third Test. Indeed, Dawson was the most expensive of England's bowlers, often providing a release for the South Africa batsmen. It was almost as if Root felt like he had to bowl him simply because he was in the side. In all, the six bowlers that England have in their side is probably too many. It creates a problem for the captain in juggling them, and perhaps even puts doubt in a bowler's mind in that he may be thinking that he has to perform well quickly otherwise he will be replaced by one of the many other options. I would prefer to see England play an extra batsman, even if that does push the talented Moeen down to number eight. The make-up of this side is not one I expect to be mirrored during this winter's Ashes series. When England knew that the new ball was approaching, they allowed the game to drift, fiddling overs from Dawson and Keaton Jennings. It was almost as if they were waiting for James Anderson and Stuart Broad to take the wickets, rather than using the other two of their four seamers - Ben Stokes and Mark Wood - with the old ball. Often, the whole point of a new ball is that you are using it against a new batsman. England may have missed a trick by taking the foot off the gas at that moment. Root's other issue on Friday was the use of the review system, with both of England's referrals frittered away inside 24 overs. On both occasions, headstrong bowlers in Stokes and Broad wanted reviews, only to see that their lbw appeals were turned down for pretty obvious reasons. It's tricky for Root, because the new captain has to feel his way in, not only with the technology, but with experienced bowlers, of whom he wants to gain their trust. In these situations, bowlers are always likely to be biased, with a more streetwise skipper less likely to be concerned by their demands for a review. It is something that Root will learn from and he may well be saying to his players that more discussion is needed to ensure they get the reviews right. All in all, it was an excellent day of Test cricket that leaves the match set-up for the weekend and beyond. South Africa's Quentin de Kock, a freescoring left-hander, made batting look terribly easy before playing a horrible shot, while his opposite number Jonny Bairstow goes from strength to strength behind the stumps for England. After taking a wonderful catch at Lord's, Bairstow took a similar one here to remove Proteas captain Faf du Plessis. From being a keeper who made one mistake per Test, Bairstow has made a massive improvement. There has been talk of bringing in Jos Buttler to allow Bairstow to concentrate on his batting. I can tell you that Bairstow would be devastated if the gloves were taken from him. There was a lovely moment for Anderson, who became the bowler to take 300 Test wickets in England, but I thought he bowled a little too short, especially with the second new ball. Broad, on his home ground, was the pick of England's pace bowlers. It was Broad who took two wickets after tea to begin the South Africa collapse, only for Vernon Philander and Chris Morris to steady their situation. Their efforts have left the contest wonderfully even.

{"article": "Experts and campaigners despair that transport doesn't get the prominence during elections they think it deserves considering it affects everyone. Remember that much of transport policy in London is devolved to the mayor, however there are some differences in how the main parties are approaching it. While there is not a huge amount of detail - for example none of the parties outline what they will do with rail fare increases - here are some highlights: We have come full circle with the Tories and Labour on this issue. Both have supported and opposed the enlargement of Heathrow at different times but now both support expansion. This is despite high profile members in both parties, like Boris Johnson and John McDonnell, opposing it. The parties now agree a third runway is needed for the economy and UK PLC. But it's not the end of the debate for this most contentious of issues. The Conservatives have said it before, and it is in the Labour manifesto, that they will only allow expansion if strict limits on night flights, pollution and noise are abided by. Campaigners have also moved in that direction and also want strong, legally binding limits on a third runway that could even stop it being built. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens oppose expansion so there are plenty of political battles ahead. This is where there are big differences between the two main parties. The Conservatives want to continue with its franchise system, with different rail companies bidding to run services. But Labour wants to renationalise the rail industry, so when franchises come up for renewal they will be put \"back into public ownership\". But it doesn't seem to be a move back to British Rail, the nationalised rail service which ended in 1997. As quoted in the Evening Standard, Labour would hand control of the capital's key commuter routes to Transport for London. The transport authority already runs a model where it pays a private operator to run a service on its behalf, for example the DLR and the London Overground. This means TfL sets the prices and keeps the farebox but also shoulders the revenue risk. Labour also seem to be saying private operators will still be involved in London's commuter routes although there is some debate over whether this is actually renationalisation. The Liberal Democrats say: \"We will allow public sector bodies and mutual groups involving staff and passengers to bid for franchises.\" All the main parties now support HS2 but the Greens do still oppose it. And while the Liberal Democrats and Labour emphasise the need for Crossrail 2 - a rail line to link Hertfordshire to Surrey through central London - the Tories do not mention it in their manifesto. Many experts believe Crossrail 2 is crucial to London to relieve congestion as the city continues to grow. So is it dead? Well there is a school of thought that thinks it is still very possible and its omission from the Tory manifesto is more to do with political positioning than infrastructure investment, i.e. it could still go ahead with the right funding.", "question": "Lurking under the @placeholder of Brexit and not getting much in the way of attention , are the main parties transport policies .", "option_0": "team", "option_1": "world", "option_2": "shadow", "option_3": "side", "option_4": "words", "label": 2}

{"article": "Scientists held their breath as they waited to see whether Juno would make it into orbit - or whether it would just fly off and miss Jupiter completely. Luckily, it successfully began its orbit on Tuesday. It's part of a special mission to help scientists find out more about our biggest planet, and how the solar system began. Juno blasted off in 2011, and will now orbit Jupiter 32 times - floating just 3,100 miles above the planet's cloud tops, for around one year. During this time it will be gathering lots of research and feeding it back to scientists here on Earth. There will also be three passengers on the spacecraft - these three Lego figures. They are the Roman god Jupiter, his wife Juno and the 17th century Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. They had to be made from aluminium rather than plastic so they could cope with the extreme conditions of going into space. Juno's main goal is to try to understand how Jupiter was formed and how it has changed over the years. Scientists hope that by researching this, they will have a better idea of how other giant gas planets are created in different solar systems as well as our own. This is because Jupiter is one of our largest planets, and it's likely it was one of the first planets in our solar system to form when a huge cloud of dust and gas collapsed more than four million years ago. It's mostly made from two gases, hydrogen and helium, which are also present in the Sun. So, scientists think that by studying Jupiter's atmosphere they will learn more about how our planets formed. Jupiter has a very thick layer of gas and cloud surrounding it. Scientists hope that by observing these clouds, and discovering what they are made of, monitoring their temperature, and movements, they can learn more about the planet and other gas planets. One of the things they are hoping to find out, is how much water and ammonia is in Jupiter's atmosphere. Researchers are hoping to find out whether or not Jupiter has a solid core in the middle of the planet. As it is covered in a thick layer of gas, it has been very hard for scientists to learn more about its structure in the past. However, Juno is equipped with some pretty special gadgets which they are hoping will reveal the secrets of Jupiter's centre. It will help to research Jupiter's gravitational and magnetic fields, to help figure out how big its core is, or if it even has one!", "question": "A Nasa spacecraft @placeholder Juno has begun its orbit of the planet Jupiter .", "option_0": "state", "option_1": "called", "option_2": "company", "option_3": "provides", "option_4": "represents", "label": 1}

Protests against police killings of unarmed black men continued on Sunday, but turned violent in California. Others demonstrations, including in Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia and New York City, were peaceful. Protesters have been angered by the deaths, including those of Eric Garner, killed in a chokehold in New York, and Michael Brown, who was shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson. In both cases grand juries decided not to press criminal charges against the white police officers responsible. \"The horrible events surrounding the death of Eric Garner have revealed a deep crisis of confidence in some of the fundamental elements of our criminal justice system,\" Mr Schneiderman said in a statement. The New York attorney general has asked Governor Cuomo to sign an executive order putting his office in charge of investigating such deaths. \"A common thread in many of these cases is the belief of the victim's family and others that the investigation of the death, and the decision whether to prosecute, have been improperly and unfairly influenced by the close working relationship between the county district attorney and the police officers he or she works with and depends on every day,\" the statement continued. Mr Schneiderman said he had no doubt that the \"overwhelming majority\" of local prosecutors are \"conscientious about our ethical duty to see that justice is done in every case\" but said it was a matter of public confidence.

Pakistan called the strikes an \"illusion\" and denied Indian claims it was behind the militant attack.

{"article": "Aberdeen, Glasgow, St Andrews and University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) have been accused of having \"significant\" gender pay gaps. The University and College Union (UCU) said the difference in pay amounted to thousands of pounds. But the universities said UCU had used out of date data that did not reflect \"hard work\" to redress pay issues. The union criticises the universities in its Holding Down Women's Pay report, released to mark International Women's Day. UCU compiled the gender pay figures using its new online tool, Rate for the job, which allows union members to make comparisons between pay rates at universities. UHI was found to have the biggest gender pay gap in the UK, according to UCU's tool. The union said UHI paid female lecturers \u00a318,637 less a year than their male colleagues. The pay gap at Aberdeen was \u00a39,914, Glasgow's \u00a39,244 and St Andrews' \u00a38,699. UCU Scotland official, Mary Senior, said: \"These universities should not have allowed such shameful levels of pay inequality to persist. \"It's nearly 50 years since the Equal Pay Act came into force and they're still flying in the face of it. \"Today on International Women's Day, we'd like to see a firm commitment from sector leaders to close the gap and are offering to work with institutions to put an end to pay inequality.\" UHI is a partnership of 13 colleges and research institutions spread across the Highlands, Western Isles, Northern Isles, Moray and Argyll. A spokesman for the university said UHI recognised that it did have a gender pay gap, but it was not of the \"magnitude\" suggested by UCU. He said: \"The figure and gap quoted derive from the data the university submitted to Higher Education Statistics Agency in 2013/14 in respect of the small number of staff  - 44 - who had academic roles and were employed directly by the university. \"A number of these roles represent the academic staff within the Centre for History and the Centre for Health Sciences, but a significant number are senior roles with pan-university responsibilities.\" Aberdeen University said the UCU figures were not up to date. A spokesman said: \"We have worked extremely hard to redress gender pay issues. Our current gender pay gap for lecturers is 1% and for senior lecturers is 2.5%. \"The professorial pay gap has reduced in recent years to a level of 7% and we continue to address this matter through our senior staff pay policy.\" Glasgow said it was fully committed to gender pay equality.

She said: \"Our figures for 2015 show that the gender pay gap among lecturers in St Andrews is \u00a3173 per year, nowhere near the figure of over \u00a38,000 quoted by the union. \"We are committed to continuing to address gender pay gaps across all grades of staff and like many universities have made strong and significant progress in recent years.\"", "question": "Four Scottish universities have @placeholder their records on pay for male and female members of staff .", "option_0": "defended", "option_1": "closed", "option_2": "updated", "option_3": "continued", "option_4": "opened", "label": 0}
{"article": "A report commissioned by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the authority was \"not fit for purpose\". Council leader Paul Lakin has resigned and the council cabinet will also quit. An earlier inquiry found 1,400 children were abused by gangs of men, mainly of Pakistani origin, from 1997 to 2013. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the latest report, by Louise Casey, the director-general for troubled families at the Communities Department, identified \"a number of potentially criminal matters\". Files passed to the NCA relate to one former and one existing councillor arising from the inquiry, Ms Casey's spokesperson said. Investigators found the council had a \"deep-rooted\" culture of cover-ups and silencing whistleblowers, Ms Casey said. It also found the child sexual exploitation (CSE) team was poorly directed, suffered from excessive case loads, and did not share information between agencies. Ms Casey said: \"This inspection revealed past and present failures to accept, understand and combat the issue of child sexual exploitation, resulting in a lack of support for victims and insufficient action against known perpetrators.\" A spokesman for the NCA said it would \"examine a number of potentially criminal matters identified during a recent inspection of Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council.\" Mr Pickles said he planned to give control of the council to a team of five commissioners, including an overall lead and one tasked specifically with looking at children's services. 1,400 children were abused, 1997-2013 5 resignations, including South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright and Council leaders Roger Stone and Paul Lakin 5 reports published since August 2014 10 South Yorkshire Police officers under investigation by the IPCC 7,000 documents reviewed for Louise Casey Report They would \"provide new leadership\" and take over the roles of the \"wholly dysfunctional cabinet,\" he said. The council has 14 days to respond to his \"wholly exceptional\" proposals, Mr Pickles said. He also plans to impose early elections in 2016. The elections would give people a chance to \"renew the membership of their council and elect those they have confidence in\", he explained. He said he hoped control would be returned to Rotherham Council as \"rapidly as possible\". In a statement the council said it needed \"time to understand and respond to the detailed report\". It said: \"We recognise the need for a fresh start that is so clearly identified in the report, but also appreciate that we need to continue to deliver services to the people of Rotherham, and ensure business continuity. \"We should not forget that the publication of this report will re-open old wounds for the victims and survivors of CSE. \"We will continue to put in place the help and support they need at this difficult time, including our dedicated helpline.\" Ms Casey was asked by Mr Pickles to inspect the council in the wake of the Jay Report in August 2014. A victim's story \"You could tell with my appearance. I went to five-and-a-half stone and different coloured hair. I was a totally different person. \"Obviously, there were warning signs there. I wasn't going to school, I wasn't going home so there's no way that they couldn't have realised that something was wrong. \"A worker got involved with me. She was trying to tell people what was happening but nobody would listen. \"There were various authorities that knew what was going off and decided to ignore it. I had a child protection officer, she ignored it, someone from social services, they ignored it. \"There were various meetings about me, which were saying if there was anybody found to be dead it'd be me.\" The inspection team reviewed about 7,000 documents, looked in detail at case files and met more than 200 people, including current and former staff, council members, partners, victims and parents. According to the report, child abusers in Rotherham are identified but \"little or no action is taken to stop or even disrupt their activities\". Rotherham Council demonstrated a \"resolute denial\" of the child abuse that was taking place, the report found. Ms Casey said the local authority was \"repeatedly told\" by its own youth service what was happening. It chose, she said \"not only to not act, but to close that service down.\" Attitudes within the council include dismissal of Prof Jay's findings, denial of knowledge of the \"scale and scope\" of CSE, blaming others and denial that CSE remains a serious problem in present-day Rotherham. The council also had an \"excessive deference\" to South Yorkshire Police, preventing the use of council powers to tackle perpetrators, and a lack of scrutiny over the police's actions. Investigators were told that former council leader Roger Stone had been \"a bully\". \"What Stone said, went,\" a senior officer told the investigation. \"Everyone was terrified of Stone.\" A councillor said: \"He is a bully, in my opinion. In Labour group he would impress himself on people, male or female. A lot of women have felt a sense of suppression and macho culture.\" Mr Stone declined to be interviewed by investigators but sent a statement instead. Michael Buchanan, BBC Social Affairs Correspondent In the days after the Alexis Jay report was published, Rotherham council promised much - they'd learn lessons, they'd support victims, they'd change. It hasn't happened. Behind closed doors, they've poured scorn on the Jay report, still fear being called racist rather than acknowledge problems with Pakistani heritage men and most damningly of all are still failing to protect vulnerable children. Faced with such appalling incompetence, the government have acted in the only way they could. Changing the culture and practices of the council won't happen overnight but it's necessary. The people of Rotherham - in particular the children at continuing risk of sexual abuse - deserve nothing else. Ms Casey's report is the latest in a series of investigations following the publication of the Jay Report in August 2014. Prof Alexis Jay found an estimated 1,400 children had been sexually abused in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. Children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted, trafficked to other cities in England, beaten and intimidated. Staff at the council did not report issues for fear of appearing racist, Ms Casey's report found. But the investigators said that by failing to take action against the abusers of Pakistani heritage, the council had \"inadvertently fuelled the far right and allowed racial tensions to grow\". The report added the lack of action had done a great disservice to the Pakistani community. Two investigations by Commons committees have been launched since the Jay Report was published and a number of high-profile figures have resigned including Shaun Wright, South Yorkshire's police and crime commissioner, who had been a councillor in the town and responsible for children's services. Roger Stone, the chief executive Martin Kimber and the council's director of children's services Joyce Thacker also quit. Mr Wright also refused to be interviewed for Ms Casey's report and sent a statement saying he had been unaware of the extent of the abuse. The National Crime Agency has taken over the investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham and is in the preliminary stage of its inquiry. Last month, Ofsted admitted to the Communities and Local Government Committee that its inspections of children's services in the town had been \"not good enough\". Inspectors from the regulator failed to spot the extent of child sexual exploitation in the town over several years, rating the council as adequate. Meanwhile, police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating 10 South Yorkshire Police officers over their handling of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham.", "question": "Government commissioners have been lined up to @placeholder at Rotherham Council where a culture of \" complete denial \" over child sexual exploitation in the town was exposed .", "option_0": "arrive", "option_1": "demonstrate", "option_2": "flee", "option_3": "stay", "option_4": "intervene", "label": 4}

{"article": "The Mid-Infrared Instrument (Miri) will gather key data as the $9bn (\u00c2\u00a35.5bn) observatory seeks to identify the first starlight in the Universe. The results of testing conducted at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK have just been signed off, clearing Miri to travel to America. James Webb - regarded as the successor to Hubble - is due to launch in 2018. It will carry a 6.5m primary mirror (more than double the width of Hubble's main mirror), and a shield the size of a tennis court to guard its sensitive vision from the heat and strong light of our Sun. The observatory has been tasked with tracking down the very first luminous objects in the cosmos - groupings of the first generation of stars to burst into life. To do so, Webb will use its infrared detectors to look deeper into space than Hubble, and further back in time - to a period more than 13 billion years ago. \"The other instruments on James Webb will do massive surveys of the sky, looking for these very rare objects; they will find the candidates,\" explained Miri's UK principal investigator, Prof Gillian Wright. \"But Miri has a very special role because it will be the instrument that looks at these candidates to determine which of them is a true first light object.  Only Miri can give us that confirmation,\" she told BBC News. JWST is a co-operative project between the US (Nasa), European (Esa) and Canadian (CSA) space agencies. Europe is providing two of the telescope's four instruments and the Ariane rocket to put it in orbit. Miri is arguably the most versatile of the four instruments, with a much wider range of detectable wavelengths than its peers (5-28 microns). Fundamentally, it is a camera system that will produce pictures of the cosmos. But it also carries a coronagraph to block the light from bright objects so it can see more easily nearby, dimmer targets - such as planets circling their stars. In addition, there is a spectrograph that will slice light into its component colours so scientists can discern something of the chemistry of far-flung phenomena. Miri is a complex design, and will operate at minus 266C. This frigid state is required for the instrument's detectors to sample the faintest of infrared sources.  Everything must be done to ensure the telescope's own heat energy does not swamp the very signal it is pursuing. The hardware for Miri has been developed by institutes and companies from across Europe and America. The job of pulling every item together and assembling the finished system has had its scientific and engineering lead in the UK. Miri has just gone through a rigorous mechanical and thermal test campaign at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Oxfordshire. This included shaking the instrument to simulate the pounding it will receive during the ascent to orbit on the Ariane. It was also put in a vacuum chamber and subjected to the kind of temperatures it will experience in space. \"It's been a real privilege to work on Miri and great to see it finally ship out,\" said Paul Eccleston, the engineer at RAL who has overseen the test campaign. \"It will be so exciting when we put it on top of the rocket and light the blue touch paper, so to speak, and watch it go up into space.\" The paperwork signing off the test results has now been accepted by Nasa. The next step is for Miri to be put in a special environment-controlled shipping box, so it can travel to the US space agency's Goddard centre. The Maryland facility is where the final integration of James Webb will take place. Miri will be fixed inside a cage-like structure called the Integrated Science Instrument Module and positioned just behind the big mirror. The years to 2018 promise yet more testing. Recommended 16 years ago as the logical evolution beyond Hubble, the JWST has managed to garner a fair amount of controversy. Technical difficulties and project mismanagement mean the observatory is now running years behind schedule and is billions of dollars over-budget. Elements of the US Congress wanted to cancel the telescope last summer.  That did not happen, but Capitol Hill now has James Webb on a very short leash, with Nasa required to provide monthly updates on milestones met or missed. Much of the talk around James Webb tends to centre on cost.  The current estimate for the US side is $8.8bn, which covers the full life cycle of the project from its inception to the end of initial operations.  Extra to that bill is some $650m for the European contributions like Miri and Ariane. Dr Eric Smith is Nasa's deputy programme director for James Webb.  He believes taxpayers do appreciate the venture. \"When you're able to show people that James Webb will do things that not even Hubble can do - then they understand it,\" he told BBC News. \"People recognise how iconic Hubble has been, and how much it has affected their lives. \"The images and scientific results that Hubble has returned have permeated popular culture. Webb pictures will be just as sharp but because the telescope will be looking at a different part of the spectrum, it will show us things that are totally new.\"", "question": "One of Europe 's main contributions to the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) is @placeholder and ready to ship to the US .", "option_0": "writing", "option_1": "expanding", "option_2": "set", "option_3": "built", "option_4": "unveiled", "label": 3}

{"article": "His relentless barrage of abuse, not least about \"fake news\", has fatally undermined the trust of the American people in their traditional sources of news; and by denying the Washington press corps access to his administration, he has neutralised a key weapon in the armoury of political journalism. Meanwhile, his use of social media, talk radio and favoured alt-right websites has allowed him to communicate directly to voters, rendering journalists an irrelevant distraction. And the Spicer Doctrine - the belief held by the White House press secretary that it is the job of government to hold media to account and not just the other way round - poses a mortal threat to the trade we call reporting. Any combination of the above paragraphs could appear, without much contention, in almost every appraisal of Trump's relationship with the media that I have read in the past year. That it has limited basis in reality, and indeed is contradicted by the vast bulk of available evidence, has been no impediment to its ubiquity. In fact, contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy, Donald Trump is not the man who will kill the mainstream media. He is the man who could save it. Together with Dominic Hurst, a brilliant producer, I have been looking at Mr Trump's relationship with the media for Radio 4's PM programme. The evidence is emphatic: Trump has given many news organisations the sustainable commercial future they so desperately crave. The New York Times, one of Mr Trump's favourite voodoo dolls, which he has repeatedly admonished on Twitter and in rallies, is doing very well out of the new president. In the three weeks after his election, it sold 132,000 digital subscriptions - a tenfold increase. That's a lot of revenue with which to fund serious journalism. I spoke to Mark Thompson, the paper's chief executive and a former director general of the BBC. He told me that the president's actions and words \"are causing hundreds of thousands of Americans who've never paid for news before to pay for it for the first time\". And he added: \"It's not a political point, it's purely a commercial point: the Trump era seems to be a very good era for quality journalism.\" CNN, the other organisation that Mr Trump has repeatedly labelled as fake news, also has plenty to thank the president for. Thanks to him, 2016 was CNN's most watched year. As for news websites like BuzzFeed News, the Guardian, Mail Online, the Independent and others, Trump has generated phenomenal traffic - which in turn boosts revenues. Two points about Mr Trump's benefit to the mainstream media strike me. The first is that it applies to different platforms and different business models. The New York Times is a newspaper and website with a semi-permeable paywall - the so-called free premium, or freemium model. The Independent has a low cost base and is funded by a huge range of advertising revenue streams. CNN is a cable news network. All are thriving just now. Second, Mr Trump has doubtless fortified the differences between the commercial and editorial departments of outlets such as these three. Take the New York Times. Columnists and leader writers on that gloriously high-minded body, the editorial board, are writing about how awful Mr Trump is, a threat to the republic, an American Putin, these are the end days, and so forth. Meanwhile, Mark Thompson is rubbing his hands with glee - not necessarily at the policies of the president, but at the ambient glow of his bottom line. Throughout my journalistic career, there have been serious questions about how journalism is funded. There is no one or easy answer to that. But based on the evidence above, a very good answer has two words - \"Donald\", and \"Trump\". This brash reality TV star has caused no end of discomfort for the mainstream media. But perhaps what should really make them squirm in their lofty op-ed conferences is the fact that he is doing more than any other modern politician to help them pay their mortgages and feed their families.

Ever since then I've been playing.\" \"A three-year-old in a wheelchair hitting tennis balls - they'd never seen it before. Ever since then I've been playing.\" Raised near Birmingham, she was named after the American basketball icon Michael Jordan. But unlike the NBA megastar, the 22-year-old has never been able to run or jump. Born with brittle bone disease, she has broken her legs more times than she can care to remember. Her mum thinks it's about 26. The first time it happened Whiley was just three months-old and her father Keith was gently winding her at the time. Since then she has been in intensive care, had a series of rods and bolts put into her legs and heard doctors tell her she would never walk unaided. They were wrong - she can now. Along with dogged determination, what Whiley also has in common with her namesake is real talent. Fuelled by winning the British national women's title at the age of 14, she went on to claim a Paralympic bronze medal at London 2012. Of even greater significance was earlier this year when Whiley made history by becoming the first British woman to win a Grand Slam wheelchair tennis title. That ground-breaking Australian Open women's doubles triumph, however, went largely unnoticed. Unlike, say, Paralympic swimming or wheelchair racing, wheelchair tennis has a low profile. Whiley finds this a little surprising, given Britain's love for tennis. But she hopes to help change that. Success is the key to becoming the next David Weir or Ellie Simmonds and, with victory alongside Japanese partner Yui Kamiij at the French Open in Paris in June, a headline-grabbing Grand Slam clean sweep is becoming a distinct possibility. Whiley has lost in the last two Wimbledon finals so is doubly determined to go one better at her favourite tournament. Should success be sealed on home soil, she and Kamiji will be the duo everyone is gunning for at the US Open. \"Winning all the Grand Slams would be amazing,\" says Whiley, whose partnership with Kamiji is ranked second, behind the previously all-conquering Dutch, in the doubles. \"That's the aim for this year.\" Beyond that goal she would like to improve her singles ranking, which is currently fifth, but Whiley is not convinced she could ever top the feeling of winning a Paralympic medal in London. \"The only thing that might be better is winning gold in Rio,\" she says. Already a countdown clock to the 2016 Paralympics is embedded in her tablet computer. Though the Paralympics are a huge motivation for Whiley - especially as it offers the largest scale of exposure - the biggest driving force of all is her father Keith. In an age when the Paralympics was almost unknown to the outside world, the design engineer won a bronze medal in the 100m sprint at the 1984 Paralympics, while also competing in other events such as wheelchair basketball. Taking up tennis when he retired, his passion was quickly transmitted to his daughter. \"I've always been close to my dad,\" says Whiley. \"Because he's got the same condition, he knows the excruciating pain that I can be in sometimes. \"And he's still a pretty cool dude. He just doesn't seem to get any older and he's got all the latest tennis gear.\" Just as Keith is her hero, Whiley could easily go on to become an inspirational figurehead for a young generation of emerging athletes - disabled or otherwise. Whiley admits she could have been a bit of a rebel had she not taken up sport, but is now wise beyond her 22 years and travels all over the world. \"I'm proof that you should never give up on your dreams. You can do anything if you put your mind to it,\" she says, smiling. If you have a disability and want to get into sport,", "question": "The first time Jordanne Whiley played tennis was in Israel .

The former Beatle struck up a friendship with the Welshman during filming for the first Beatles film, A Hard Day's Night. \"Victor was a fine man, a great pal and a fantastic actor and someone I am proud to have known for many years,\" said Sir Paul. \"His irreverent wit and exuberant personality will remain in my memory forever. \"I will miss his loyal friendship, as will all the others who were lucky enough to know and love the wonderful Mr Spinetti.\" Spinetti died at a hospice in Monmouth on Monday morning, said his agent Barry Burnett. \"He had cancer for a year, but he was very cheerful to the end,\" said Mr Burnett. \"I spoke to him on Friday and he was talking about his plans and everything.\" News of his death prompted a stream of tributes from fans and members of the entertainment world on Twitter. Barbara Windsor, a lifelong friend and co-star in Oh! What a Lovely War, had visited Spinetti last Thursday. \"We were very close. He was another of my great friends from that era. He was such a great man,\" she said. \"We just chatted and chatted and talked about old things. But he said, 'let's not talk about all that, let's talk about the future'.\" Actor Rob Brydon tweeted: \"So sad Victor Spinetti has died. The funniest story teller I've ever met and a lovely warm man. Proud to have been his friend. 'Eh, Vic...'\" Britt Ekland, actor, wrote: \"Just heard my wonderful friend, co writer and director Victor Spinetti died. Am devastated to have lost a true acting genius.\" Welsh actor Sian Phillips told BBC Wales she was shocked and saddened, adding: \"He was such a force of joy and vitality. When one saw him across a crowded room, one couldn't wait to get together with him and have a chat and a catch-up.\" Spinetti was born in the living quarters above the chip shop his family owned in Cwm, Ebbw Vale. He attended Monmouth School and initially had ambitions to be a teacher. But after turning to acting he studied at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, Cardiff. His early stage career saw him make a number of memorable performances with Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop, whose production of Oh, What a Lovely War! transferred to the West End and Broadway. It was his Tony-winning performance in Oh, What a Lovely War! that prompted the Beatles to ask him to appear in A Hard Day's Night (1964), the first of the group's five films. Spinetti's collaboration with the Beatles saw him appear in their next two productions, Help! (1965) and the hour-long television film Magical Mystery Tour (1967). He also worked with John Lennon to turn the Beatle's book, In His Own Write, in to a play which he then directed at the National Theatre. As well as the Beatles movies, Spinetti's film career included Zeffirelli's The Taming of the Shrew and a version of Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood, both alongside Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Spinetti's television roles included voicing the arch villain character Texas Pete in the S4C animated series SuperTed. He was also a noted raconteur whose creative output included poetry, an autobiography and his one-man show, A Very Private Diary. A             BBC documentary  on his life and work saw contributions from Barbara Windsor and Rob Brydon praising a \"great Welsh eccentric\" and is due to be broadcast at 22:45 BST by BBC Wales on BBC One on 20 June.", "question": "Sir Paul McCartney has @placeholder a host of celebrities to pay tribute to the actor Victor Spinetti , who has died at the age of 82 .", "option_0": "hailed", "option_1": "joined", "option_2": "engaged", "option_3": "admitted", "option_4": "visited", "label": 1}
{"article": "The Towering Inferno, released in 1974, won three Oscars and starred Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden and Faye Dunaway. Guillermin's action-packed 1976 version of King Kong, starred Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange. He died on Sunday at his home in the Topanga Canyon area of Los Angeles, his friend Nick Redman confirmed. In a statement, Guillermin's wife Mary called him \"sensitive and passionate, full of a fierce rapture himself.\" Born in London to French parents, Guillermin attended the University of Cambridge before joining the Royal Air Force. His career directing began in France with documentary film-making. In 1950, he moved to Hollywood to study film-making methods. Following the success of disaster films such as Airport and The Poseidon Adventure, Guillermin assembled a star-studded cast for The Towering Inferno. The movie, still regarded as a classic of the genre, about a fire that breaks out on the 81st floor of a shoddily-built skyscraper starred McQueen and Newman - two of the biggest film stars of the day. Known for his big budget adventures, Guillermin also had a reputation of being a difficult man to work with. In his memoirs, film editor Ralph E Winters, described an incident he witnessed when he worked with Guillermin on King Kong. In the screening room, Winters said a frustrated Guillermin kicked the seat in front until it broke. He received  an apologetic phone call the next day. In his 1995 autobiography, Charlton Heston, who worked with the director on 1972's Skyjacked, described him as having an \"irascible streak\". For 1978's adaptation of Agatha Christie's Death on the Nile, Guillermin assembled a cast of top acting talent. Peter Ustinov played the legendary sleuth Hercule Poirot alongside David Niven, George Kennedy and Angela Lansbury. He won the Evening Standard British Film Award in 1980 for the movie.

{"article": "Whether for team building, forward planning, or to raise money for charity, the thought of such organised days away from the office can make even the bravest shudder. And it is hard to know what is worse - being forced to do something wacky, or having to sit in the conference room of a dreary hotel  for hours on end while your boss drones on about the year ahead. Thankfully for the sanity of middle managers everywhere, a new type of business away day is now increasingly on the menu - team-building cookery classes. So instead of having to try to keep up with Tim from accounting on a space hopper, or build a raft with Karen from HR, an office team or department will make a meal together in a professional kitchen. London-based Food@Work is one firm that organises such away days. Launched in 2002, it faced some tough trading in 2008 during the global financial crisis, but says business is now growing strongly again. Founder and owner Robinne Collie, 44, says there is not a \"usual month\" at the company, which charges from \u00c2\u00a3125 per person. \"Some months we do one very large event, like a charity event we ran for 500 participants, or we can run up to six smaller events with 12 to 40 participants. \"I don't do more than six a month ever. I prefer four at most, because it's crazy busy.\" A recent customer of Food@Work was UK building products group SIG, which sent along a team to cook a three-course meal of twice-baked cheese souffles, roulade of chicken in a Madeira jus, and apple tartlets with a salted caramel sauce. \"It was a frantic few hours of fun in the kitchen,\" says Duncan Longson, SIG's European financial controller. \"It was great to experience the atmosphere of a professional kitchen, and an excellent team-building exercise.\" Peter Hallard, SIG's group talent and development director, adds: \"The heat of the professional kitchen and the stress of making a souffle stretched even the most seasoned of senior executives.\" Another business that offers team-building cookery classes for corporate clients is Waffle Workshop, which is based in Brussels. Founded in 2015 by Titch Fauconnier, the 29-year-old was originally targeting the tourism market, but decided to add corporate events after visitor numbers to the Belgian capital fell sharply last year following the bomb attack at the city's airport. Waffle Workshop now organises two or three two-hour team building events per month, with up to 29 participants taking part each time, at a cost of 28 euros per person ($30; \u00c2\u00a324). Mr Fauconnier says that attendees \"discover another side of the people they work with\". At the beginning he says he worried that those attending the corporate events would be reluctant to participate because it wasn't their choice to be there, but he says that his fears were soon proved to be wrong. \"After hosting many of these team-building events I have never experienced a lack of motivation from participants. They were always happy to do something out of the office,\" says Mr Fauconnier. In France, L'Atelier des Sens is one of the largest providers of cookery classes for corporate clients. Such events now make up 60% of its annual turnover of 2.5m euros. The business holds up to 150 team-building classes each month, with groups of typically 20 people cooking three-course meals at three venues in Paris, and one in Lyon. It uses 50 professional chefs to lead the events. Founder and owner Natacha Burtinovic, 42, says what is particularly interesting is the fact that \"sometimes the hierarchy that exists at work does not exist in our kitchens\". Back at Food@Work, which now uses up to 26 professional chefs to run the classes, Ms Collie says that running the events for 15 years has turned her into a keen kitchen-based psychologist. She says: \"Naturally organised people keep a clean workbench, and are clear on what they are doing, the task to follow. \"Process orientated people read recipes... while some people are so motivated by results and getting the job done quickly that they fail to get it done right. \"We have seen it all - shock, horror, fear, delight, some people wanting to run away, some wanting to get stuck in immediately.\" But what do the experts think? Lisa Lyons, a human resources boss at consultancy group Mercer, says that like any team-building event, cookery classes \"have the potential to accelerate the overall performance of the team\". However, Ms Lyons cautions that team-building events should be \"integrated as part of a longer-term approach to developing the team\". In other words, a company cannot hold a one-off cooking day - or visit an assault course - and then expect to have a harmonious and successful workplace forever after.", "question": "If you have ever been forced to race your boss around an assault course , or pass a beach ball to a colleague without using your @placeholder , then you have probably sampled the horror of a company away day .", "option_0": "generations", "option_1": "head", "option_2": "body", "option_3": "collection", "option_4": "hands", "label": 4}
{"article": "The prospect of losing a vital source of income would force Mexico into a \"one-time payment\" of $5-10bn (\u00c2\u00a33.5-7bn), says Mr Trump. But US President Barack Obama said the plan was \"half-baked\" and unworkable. Mr Trump made his remarks as voters in Wisconsin go the polls to pick their presidential candidates in each party. The vote could reshape the Republican race, with front-runner Mr Trump, who has never held elected office, facing a strong challenge from Texas Senator Ted Cruz. In a memo to the Washington Post, the businessman says he would threaten to change a law to cut off cash transfers. Building a border wall with Mexico has been a core message of Mr Trump's campaign since day one, when he said there were rapists, drug addicts and criminals coming across the border. If Donald Trump isn't the 2016 Republican presidential nominee - if some time between now and the end of the party convention in late July the prize slips from his grasp, Wisconsin could be where it all started to go awry. At this point it's conventional wisdom that Mr Trump has had a terrible week on the campaign trail. His top aide was indicted for accosting a reporter. He stumbled when trying to answer questions about abortion, angering both the left and the right. Wisconsin's popular Republican Governor Scott Walker endorsed his opponent, Ted Cruz. And Mr Trump saw his lead in this pivotal mid-western state evaporate. By Sunday evening, at a rally in a half-full downtown Milwaukee theatre, the front-runner was showing signs of frustration. He mocked his opponents in the #neverTrump movement, which has vowed to fight the New Yorker to the July Republican convention and beyond. Is it all going wrong for Trump in Wisconsin? The wall plan has been widely condemned by, among others, Pope Francis. Mr Trump has also pledged to deport all 11 million undocumented migrants. The Mexican central bank said that money sent home from overseas hit nearly $24.8bn last year, more than its oil revenues. In dismissing the plan, Mr Obama said it would cause the Mexican economy to collapse, sending even more migrants north to find work in the US. \"This is another example of something that's not thought through and put forward for political consumption,\" he said. The law Mr Trump wishes to change, as outlined in his memo, is part of the US Patriot Act - he would stop anyone living illegally in the US from sending money overseas. Just the threat of enacting this would make Mexico \"immediately protest,\" the Trump memo reads, and they would be compelled to pay for the wall. He also proposed raising visa fees and cancelling visas for Mexicans. If Mr Cruz wins in Wisconsin, as polls suggest, it will help him close the gap on Mr Trump in the all-important delegate count. Delegates represent their states at the party's convention in July and are accumulated by the votes in each state. A Wisconsin defeat would make it is far less likely that Mr Trump will have the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination. If he falls short, his unpopularity with sections of his party means he could be deprived of the nomination at the summer convention. Currently, Mr Trump has 735 delegates, Mr Cruz 461 and Ohio Governor John Kasich 143. Democratic voters are also voting in Wisconsin, with Hillary Clinton facing a strong challenge from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders after his string of wins.", "question": "Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump has said he would stop cash sent home by Mexicans @placeholder in the US , until the country pays for a border wall .", "option_0": "forces", "option_1": "control", "option_2": "based", "option_3": "staying", "option_4": "side", "label": 2}

Mr Cameron, whose party is split on the EU, has refused to take part in any head-to-head TV debates with fellow Conservatives who back leaving the union. But a number of debates and live Q&As are planned, including the BBC's event at Wembley Arena on 21 June. Ahead of the hour-long Sky News show, which started at 20:00 BST, Mr Gove said he was feeling \"nervous\" but was hoping to \"allay people's fears\" about leaving the EU. In his appearance, Mr Cameron was pressed on immigration from within the EU, warning that voting to Leave in order to try to control it would \"trash\" the economy. Mr Gove and the Leave campaign have been campaigning hard on migration in recent weeks, calling for a points-based system for EU migrants if the UK severs its ties with Brussels.

{"article": "The EU \"sealed a solid pact to strengthen the euro,\" said European Council President Herman Van Rompuy. A permanent fund will be set up to bolster the euro in times of crisis, and the EU will have extra powers of scrutiny over national budgets. A 2.9% limit on the EU budget increase was also agreed, under UK pressure. But tough negotiations are expected with the European Parliament, which voted for a 5.9% rise. If no deal is reached by mid-November the 2011 budget will be frozen at the 2010 level. EU officials said the eurozone had almost collapsed during the Greek debt crisis in May because it lacked a rescue mechanism. Q&A: EU crisis mechanism EU budget: Where does your money go? Germany wants limited changes to the EU's Lisbon Treaty to reinforce the changes, but is facing resistance from other countries. The leaders will return to Brussels in December, hoping to agree upon any revision, which it is hoped will be ratified in all EU countries by mid-2013. Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister David Cameron won backing for his battle against a 5.9% rise in the EU budget. Germany and France were among 10 nations supporting Mr Cameron's attempt to limit the budget increase to 2.9% - a rise that would still cost UK taxpayers roughly \u00c2\u00a3435m (500m euros). \"Now we have agreed that the EU budget must reflect what we're doing in our own countries,\" Mr Cameron said, describing the deal as \"incredibly important\". He will have further talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at his Chequers residence on Saturday. The bigger prize for Mr Cameron would be a deal to keep the UK's hard-won budget rebate, as difficult talks loom on the EU budget period beyond 2013. The BBC's Jonty Bloom, in Brussels, says the new crisis mechanism is designed to force a country to put its house in order long before its economic problems threaten the eurozone. Under the rules, EU officials will warn governments about property and speculative bubbles, and will be able to impose stringent fines on countries that borrow and spend too much. The permanent crisis fund will replace a temporary one, worth 440bn euros, which expires in 2013. It was created earlier this year to bail out Greece and support the euro. Cameron's EU budget battleUK wins allies in EU budget spat But Germany has argued that the Lisbon Treaty will have to be amended to make the emergency fund permanent and legally watertight. The current treaty contains a clause banning members from bailing each other out. Chancellor Merkel said all the leaders agreed that creating a permanent crisis mechanism \"will require a limited treaty change\". It took almost a decade of hard negotiations and two referendums in the Republic of Ireland to ratify the Lisbon Treaty, and many states are reluctant to make a move which could trigger a similar process. The EU Constitution - the treaty's ill-fated forerunner - was rejected by voters in France and the Netherlands. Mr Van Rompuy has been tasked with finding out whether the fund can be set up without each of the 27 member states having to ratify the treaty all over again. The UK says a mechanism to ensure stability in the eurozone is desirable - and that the planned sanctions would not apply to the UK. But all 27 member states' budgets will come under close scrutiny in a \"peer review\" process. There would be escalating sanctions on countries which overshot the maximum debt level allowed under the EU's Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which is 60% of GDP. Sanctions would kick in earlier than is the case under the current SGP, enabling the EU to take preventive action, for example against a country with an unsustainable housing bubble, or with mounting debt that undermines its competitiveness.", "question": "EU leaders say tough new budget rules agreed at their summit in Brussels will protect the euro from a future Greek - @placeholder debt crisis .", "option_0": "style", "option_1": "bulgarian", "option_2": "growing", "option_3": "signature", "option_4": "tank", "label": 0}

They had been playing together during an access visit in February when Anderson suddenly struck his son with a cricket bat and stabbed him. The coroner will examine what the authorities could have done differently to have prevented Luke's death. Anderson was shot by police after threatening them with a knife when they tried to detain him. He died later in hospital. The very public killing of the young boy shocked the nation in a way that many other acts of family violence committed every week in Australia have not. His death and his mother's emergence as an articulate and powerful advocate for the rights of women and children living in violent relationships have given new force to efforts to prevent domestic violence both in Victoria and the rest of the country. \"When this is all over, I still won't get my little boy back,\" Rosie Batty, Anderson's estranged former partner, told the court. \"I never want anyone to be sitting where I'm sitting and lose their son like I lost mine.\" Ms Batty's powerful campaigning on the issue since has attracted a nomination for Australian of the Year. One leading academic recently said Ms Batty had put domestic violence at the top of the political agenda in a way that decades of research had not managed. In Victoria, it is a key campaign issue for all political parties ahead of that state's 29 November election. At Monday's inquiry, a large photograph of Luke was beside Ms Batty on the witness stand as she outlined the multiple interactions she had had in recent years with police, courts and child protection that ultimately failed to prevent Anderson from murdering their son. Ms Batty did not speak directly to the media but had said ahead of the inquest that she wanted it to uncover the \"systematic failings\" which she believes occurred in the lead-up to Luke's death. At times quietly breaking down, Ms Batty detailed how she had considered calling the police when she had seen Anderson earlier on the night he killed Luke, knowing he had a number of outstanding warrants for his arrest, mostly related to threats he had made against her. She decided not to for Luke's sake. She had done so on two previous occasions but it had been \"traumatic, stressful, unpredictable\". She knew also the police had Anderson's address and could arrest him more \"discreetly\". \"I looked at Luke and thought this is going to be the third time I've tried to have this man arrested in front of Luke and his friends.\" She said she felt relief in April 2013 when a magistrate had ordered that Anderson have no further contact with Luke but that order was later changed to allow him limited access at sports practice. Federation of Community Legal Centres policy adviser Dr Chris Atmore said Ms Batty's evidence showed \"how much we put onto abused women to basically wrangle the system by themselves\". \"There were so many points in the system she articulated today where she was expected to blow the whistle for Greg, deal with her concerns for Luke, navigate the court system, interact with police and child protection. \"What came across in a striking way is how much we expect of people in Rosie's situation.\"", "question": "A coroner 's inquiry into the killing of an 11 - year - old boy by his father has @placeholder in Victoria , Australia .", "option_0": "fallen", "option_1": "appeared", "option_2": "exploded", "option_3": "doubled", "option_4": "opened", "label": 4}
{"article": "A new study has revealed the origins of 45,000 surnames, shedding light on our ancestors' jobs, what they looked like and where they lived. Researchers at the University of the West of England spent more than six years trawling through our family names, from the run-of the-mill Joneses and Smiths to the rarer Twelvetrees and Farahs. The full list will be published in the Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland, which at \u00c2\u00a3400 is unlikely to make it to your bookshelf, but will be available in some public libraries. Here, we reveal the stories behind some of Britain's best-known names - and whether a surname can really affect how you go about your life. It's likely that your surname is based on one of four things, including: \"A Scottish name lots of people know is Cameron,\" said Dr Harry Parkin, one of the authors of the study. \"It is Scottish Gaelic in origin and means something like crooked nose or bent nose.\" The X Factor's Simon Cowell is no stranger to argument, having recently told fellow judge Nicole Scherzinger to \"shut up\" while on air. By way of excuse, Cowell's surname hints at possible warmongering origins. Cowell can derive from the Gaelic Mac Cathmhaoil, which literally means a \"son of battle chief\". I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! contestant Larry Lamb's name could come from the Irish word \"Luan\", meaning hound or warrior - no doubt a useful trait in the jungle. Rinder is one of the rarer surnames with violent connotations. It is a variation of Render, meaning \"to tear, to lacerate, to butcher\" in Middle English - perhaps a reflection of Judge Rinder's moves on Strictly Come Dancing.. The origin of celebrity couple Louise and Jamie Redknapp's surname, however, doesn't quite match their glamorous lifestyle. Roughly translating as a \"red-haired servant boy\", Redknapp - which can also mean hill - is one of 8,000 names included in the study that has not appeared in previous dictionaries. You're most likely to live next door to a family of Smiths, according to the study. With 500,000 bearers of the name today, Smith is the most common surname in Britain and Ireland, alongside: Did Linda Dunk choose to be an underwater photographer because of her surname? Or, by the same token, Henry Sick train to be a doctor? \"Actual science and research is being done to back up this theory,\" says Frank Swain of New Scientist magazine. The idea that our name influences which job we choose has earned itself the term \"nominative determinism\" - coined by the late John Hoyland, who collected odd facts about science for the magazine. \"We've collected thousands of examples over the years,\" says Mr Swain. \"It became a trope that John and myself tried in vain to kill on uncountable occasions.\" Some names can even make us more prone to illness, according to research.

{"article": "The claim: The UK can make itself energy self-sufficient in renewables. Reality Check verdict: This is not the policy in the Liberal Democrat manifesto, which pledges to get 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030. Being self-sufficient and having all energy coming from renewables would require considerable development of storage technology to avoid having to use non-renewable sources or energy bought from overseas as back-up sources. It came after he had said: \"If it is simply for hair shirt, muesli-eating, Guardian readers to solve climate change... we're all stuffed.\" Becoming energy self-sufficient in renewables is not current Liberal Democrat policy, although Mr Farron described it in a speech in February as being a \"patriotic endeavour\". The manifesto says the party would: \"Expand renewable energy, aiming to generate 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030.\" A party spokeswoman described the leader's statement in the debate as \"visionary as opposed to completely literal\". The problem with being entirely self-sufficient is that many renewable sources of energy cannot generate power all of the time (the notable exception being the burning of biomass), so if you are using a very high proportion of renewables you rely on interconnectedness (buying electricity from another country where the wind is blowing), storage (batteries in the short-term, some sort of gas storage in the longer term) or a back-up system using gas-fired power stations or nuclear energy. The Liberal Democrat manifesto talks about investing in interconnectors, which would be unnecessary if the country was to become self-sufficient. There are already private plans in place to increase the amount of electricity that may be bought from France via interconnectors. It may be that when he said self-sufficient he meant that we should not have a trade deficit in energy, so it would be OK to buy energy from other countries when we needed it as long as we sold the same amount to other countries when they needed it. While there have been suggestions that marine energy could make the UK a net exporter of electricity, being self-sufficient and generating 100% of energy from renewables is considerably more challenging than, for example, 90%, mainly because of the challenges of storage. The development of a smart grid, which co-ordinates renewable energy supplies depending on demand, may also be needed for a 100% renewable system. Also, while the Liberal Democrat manifesto targets 60% of electricity, Mr Farron was talking about all energy, which means, for example, that all cars have to run on renewable energy and all buildings have to be heated by it. So in 2016, the UK generated 24.4% of its electricity from renewables, but in 2015 (the latest year available) it was only producing 8.8% of energy from renewables. The UK has an obligation under European Union rules to derive 30% of electricity from renewables by 2020, which it is on the way to achieving (although the UK is currently scheduled to have left the EU by then). But the other two parts of the targets are 12% of heat and 10% of transport to be powered by renewables, which we are less likely to achieve. The Labour manifesto pledges to get 60% of energy from zero-carbon or renewable sources by 2030. The Conservative manifesto looks at it in a different way, saying that \"energy policy should be focused on outcomes rather than the means by which we reach our objectives\". So they say that the focus will not be on how the energy is generated but on achieving, \"reliable and affordable energy, seizing the industrial opportunity that new technology presents and meeting our global commitments on climate change\". The Green Party would have a target of near-100% renewable electricity generation by 2030 with significant investment in electric vehicles and lower-carbon sources of heating. It supports self-sufficiency and a decentralised system of communities owning their own generation systems, but would also invest in interconnectors to allow for co-operation with other countries.

{"article": "On Tuesday, Pope Francis will open the original Holy Door at St Peter's Basilica in Rome, the first time it has been opened since the turn of the century, to mark the official start of a year laden with symbolism for Catholics across the world. So what does it mean? The clue to the aim of the Year of Mercy is in its name: a time for the Church itself and for Catholics everywhere to show mercy and compassion, in thought and in deed, and focus on forgiveness, reconciliation and doing good in concrete ways for the needy and those on the margins of society. The crossing of the threshold of a Holy Door is a sign of spiritual renewal, and the passage from sin to grace. Pope Francis has long signalled his wish to change the Church's approach from condemnation of wrongdoing to a Church more forgiving of its flock, and more understanding of the difficulties faced by believers today. This extraordinary jubilee year is a practical way of giving expression to that wish, and creating a Church that is a \"field hospital\", healing and binding the wounds of its flock. Announcing the extraordinary jubilee this March, the Pope said: \"The greater the sin, the greater the love the Church must express,\" writing that the Holy Door is a \"Door of Mercy, through which anyone who enters will experience the love of God who consoles, pardons and instils hope.\" Pope Francis took many by surprise when he announced earlier this year that as part of the jubilee, all parish priests across the world would be allowed to absolve repentant women who asked for forgiveness for having an abortion, even though Church teaching still terms abortion a grave sin. He has, in effect, already begun the jubilee by opening the Holy Door of the Cathedral in Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic, during his recent trip to Africa. It was one of many symbolic gestures he made in a nation torn by fighting between Christians and Muslims. The Pope has also made clear he wants this jubilee to open a year of \"fervent dialogue\" between Christians, Muslims and Jews, so that all who believe in a merciful God show more mercy towards one another, driving out violence, disrespect and discrimination. He said that the Christian profession of faith in God's mercy \"relates us to Judaism and Islam, both of which consider mercy to be one of God's most important attributes\". In a year marked by cruel conflicts, terrorist attacks and natural disasters across the globe, the jubilee is expected to draw millions of pilgrims to Rome, where the city authorities and the Vatican have been working together to ensure security. Italian security forces will be on high alert, while Rome has declared a no-fly zone for drones as well as regular aircraft, although Vatican officials say they had no knowledge of any specific or credible plot to attack the city or the Vatican. While  trusting in God, the Vatican has also invested in earthly technology, with visitors having to pass through metal detectors on St Peter's Square before they can enter. Jubilee years are rooted in the Old Testament tradition of freeing slaves and prisoners once every 50 years, a concept that died out within Judaism but was taken up by Pope Boniface VIII for the Catholic Church in 1300. Pilgrimages to Rome were at the heart of the original jubilee years, and attracted hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to the city, many willing to pay for \"indulgences\" - the eradication by the Church of the spiritual debt arising from sin. It was a tradition that not only contributed copious cash to the Vatican's coffers, but also contributed to the theological turmoil that led to the establishment of rival Protestant churches across much of northern Europe. The last Jubilee was called by St John Paul II to mark the millennium, and this Holy Year of Mercy starts on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December 2015 and will end on the Feast of Christ the King on 20 November 2016. In an innovation by Pope Francis, Holy Doors will also be opened this year at cathedrals, some churches and shrines around the world for those unable to make the pilgrimage to Rome. In England, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, will open the Holy Door at Westminster Cathedral, while Holy Doors will also be opened in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and many churches will hold special services on Sunday to mark the start of the jubilee.", "question": "Appropriately for the weeks of Advent leading up to Christmas , carpenters and other tradespeople have been kept busy in the run -up to the Jubilee Holy Year of Mercy , installing or ensuring that the Holy Doors , due to be opened at Roman Catholic cathedrals and churches across the world , are safe and @placeholder .", "option_0": "warned", "option_1": "functioning", "option_2": "show", "option_3": "neck", "option_4": "witnessing", "label": 1}

As well as visiting the mosque, Ms Sturgeon will speak at a special peace symposium taking place at Glasgow University. Ahead of that speech, the first minister said: \"The peace symposium demonstrates the commitment of the Ahmadiyya community to promoting the values of peace, tolerance and understanding and is an important opportunity for us to restate our shared values and our shared aims. \"The launch of their 'True Islam' campaign is an important educational tool to increase awareness and understanding of the religion.

{"article": "Maybe not as bad as someone chucking a table or swinging a chair around their head, but just a pinch of spice to give what promises to be a hearty dish an appreciable edge. For once on English soil, Wladimir Klitschko was in control. Which is how he likes it. A dignified man, Klitschko doesn't look comfortable exchanging barbs with a 6ft 7in Batman. Then again, who does? A 6ft Robin? But in Anthony Joshua, Klitschko has a rival he can understand. Someone safe, just like him. At one point during his customary press conference monologue - the Ukrainian often swats away questions as if they are bothersome flies - Klitschko looked across at Joshua and said: \"We are friends.\" It sounded like a Jedi mind trick. Promoter Eddie Hearn had already warned Joshua not to be fooled. \"Joshua must not fall into that friendly-friendly trap,\" said Hearn after his charge's three-round demolition of Eric Molina on Saturday. \"He has to have that same ruthless streak he's had until now. He will, because he's a ruthless individual.\" Joshua didn't sound too ruthless, reflecting on the challenge ahead. He didn't sound too anything in particular. In fact, he made defending his world heavyweight crown against the former king in front of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium sound like a four-rounder at the Goresbrook Leisure Centre in Dagenham. When it was gently suggested that Klitschko - perhaps, just maybe - had been a little bit disrespectful by referring to him as his \"little bro\", Joshua - gently, respectfully - disagreed. \"It's fine. I let it go over my head. It's all irrelevant.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Joshua even felt the need to downgrade his one quote that might have sounded a tad big-headed, insisting that victory over Klitschko would not, as he had previously stated, make him an \"overnight legend\" but would be merely the first act in creating a great legacy. In chess terms, it was moving a piece backwards. What will sell the fight is not needle and trash-talk but the question of timing. It is a classic clash of generations, between a youthful, unproven king and a battle-hardened ruler from a previous age. Has Joshua, a pro for barely three years and with 18 fights to his name, learnt enough? Or has Klitschko, a man with 64 wins from 68 pro fights and a two-time world champion, amassed too much wisdom? Will the 27-year-old Joshua have too much hunger and too much athleticism for a man 14 years his senior? Did Klitschko's chastening defeat by Tyson Fury in Dusseldorf last November, which brought to an end his second, nine-year reign, show that he was past it? Can Joshua take his power? Can the Englishman go past seven rounds, as he has never done before? Is he in the same class as Fury? For his part, Klitschko believes his year and a half out of the ring - two scheduled rematches against Fury fell through because of injuries and the Manchester fighter's struggles with mental illness - have refreshed him. \"My brother [Vitali, the former twice heavyweight world champion] said a four-year break was good for him,\" said Klitschko. \"It sounds like I'm really old but I don't feel this way. I was not sitting back, drinking beer and doing nothing.\" Two training camps for fights that never happened might have kept him active but there are times when Klitschko's thinking sounds wishful, as when he insists that both his hands and his reflexes have become faster with age. Before the wily Fury rendered Klitschko almost punchless, there were clear signs of deterioration when he fought unheralded American Bryant Jennings. And if Klitschko really is speeding up after 40, he's a scientific miracle. However, it is entirely possible that nine years of largely one-side victories dulled the senses, imperceptibly. Between regaining a portion of the world heavyweight crown in 2006 and losing it to Fury, Klitschko made 18 defences, as many as Joshua has had pro fights. All that winning can become mundane. \"The Fury defeat woke me up,\" said Klitschko, who has had 27 world title fights in total. \"After so many years I realised I was not as motivated. \"Maybe it sounds crazy, but it was good that I lost that fight and good that I'm the underdog for this one. It's nice being the challenger again. I have an adrenaline rush in my blood. I've been missing it. This time I'm obsessed.\" Klitschko and Joshua sparred 20 rounds at the former's Austrian bolthole in 2014, before Klitschko's five-round knockout of Bulgaria's Kubrat Pulev. Both men will have learnt a thing or two, but not nearly enough. \"Klitschko didn't perform against Fury so when he says he's obsessed, that's him saying he wants to show people how good he actually is,\" said Joshua, who won Olympic super-heavyweight gold in 2012, 16 years after Klitschko. \"They say he didn't throw enough punches against Fury. Believe me, he will throw punches against me. If he wins, he will say: 'I'm still the big bro.' But if he loses he will realise that the torch has changed hands, that this is a completely different era. And after that, I want to be doing it for years. \" Some have suggested that Joshua-Klitschko isn't as big or as relevant as both camps would like us to believe, because Fury is the main man. But their point is largely irrelevant. Fury briefly had it all but was forced to abdicate. He owns no world titles, he currently has no boxing licence, he might never fight again.

Two of the other men, skipper Jamie Green and Zoran Dresic, also received 24-year sentences, while Daniel Payne received 18 years and Scott Birtwistle 14. They had been charged with conspiring to import Class A drugs. Now a new lawyer, Emily Bolton, is working on their case. She founded the Innocence Project New Orleans in the US, which has so far freed 25 prisoners, and has recently set up a new charity in the UK - the Centre for Criminal Appeals - to specialise in miscarriage of justice investigations. On 29 May 2010, a small fishing boat - the Galwad-Y-Mor - left the Isle of Wight on what the crew claim was a routine trip to catch lobster and crab in the Channel. That night, a large drugs operation led by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - known as Operation Disorient - was taking place, involving surveillance planes, a Border Agency patrol boat and police lookouts along the coast. The authorities had intelligence that cocaine was being smuggled to Europe from South America on giant cargo ships, such as the container vessel MSC Oriane - which was one of nine from Brazil that appeared to be of particular interest. At about midnight, the ship and the fishing boat briefly came close together - though exactly how close is disputed. The ship went on towards the European mainland, and the Galwad continued home, past Freshwater Bay - the western tip of the Isle of Wight. The next day, at this same bay, a member of the public spotted 11 sacks tangled around a buoy - each packed with a pure form of cocaine. The prosecution's case was that the sacks were pushed off the side of the container ship for the fishermen to retrieve from the sea, before taking them to the bay to hide or be picked up by another vessel. But Ms Bolton disputes this. \"What the police are alleging [is that the Galwad] was able to pinpoint and locate 11 bags of cocaine in the English Channel, in shipping lanes, in the middle of the night in a storm,\" she says. \"We think we now have the evidence proving this simply couldn't have taken place.\" At the trial, the prosecution relied on navigational data taken from on-board computers on the two vessels, which purported to show that - around midnight - the Galwad crossed the Oriane's wake. There would have been a short window for the 11 sacks of cocaine to be transferred to the fishing boat. However, Ms Bolton says the prosecution's expert witness left out key plot points and used damaged data. Her new analysis suggests the paths of the boats were never closer than 100m from one another, and that the sea's drift would have taken the drugs away from the fishermen's boat. \"If that intersection between the vessels never took place, there is no case,\" she says. The prosecution also points to a series of calls made to and from the satellite phone on the Galwad while it was in the Channel, suggesting someone on shore was co-ordinating the drugs drop. The defence said the timing was a coincidence and someone was just checking on the health of one of the other fishermen who was seasick - a migrant from Eastern Europe. No traces of cocaine were ever found on the fishing boat, despite it being searched with specialised equipment. The container ship, the Oriane, was also searched when it next touched British shores a few days later, but no trace of drugs was ever found. No-one on the Oriane was arrested. The Galwad spent 18 hours sailing back to its home port of Yarmouth in the Isle of Wight. On the way it stopped for about an hour in Freshwater Bay - its crew say to fish for mackerel. That evening, the first arrests were made. At this point though, the drugs had not been discovered. This happened the following day, when a member of the public called to say he had spotted 11 multicoloured bags floating in Freshwater Bay. This timeframe, Ms Bolton says, was crucial. At the time the fishing boat was said to have hidden the drugs in Freshwater Bay, two officers from Hampshire police were watching from the cliff tops as part of the police operation. In the officers' logs before the drugs were found, they recorded someone on the fishing boat throwing six or seven items overboard at intervals - which the fishermen say could have been rubbish bags full of old bait. But the next day, after the drugs were discovered, the police lookouts changed the official log - as they are allowed to do - to clarify what they saw. In the new version they reported 10 to 12 items the size of a holdall, tied together in a line and deployed from the boat followed by a red floating buoy - a description that almost exactly matched the drugs that were picked up by the police boat. The two police surveillance officers then told different accounts in court. One said he was convinced of the significance of the holdalls at the time; the other said he thought little of it until after the drugs were found the next day. As a result, the new defence team claims the accounts cannot be relied upon. \"These are officers that are trained to get the details right every single time - and we are not talking about small details,\" Ms Bolton explains. \"We are talking about big changes, about what they saw and also where they saw it from.\" At trial, both police lookouts were adamant they had seen 10 to 12 sacks thrown off the fishing boat along with a buoy. After making the first log entry, they said they had seen extra bags thrown off the boat, so the amended version was the full picture of everything they had recorded that day. The Independent Police Complaints Commission did look into the case and, though it found inconsistencies in the officers' evidence, decided it was not enough to show they had fabricated their accounts. Complaints against the two officers were dismissed. Hampshire Police also said they had no ongoing complaints relating to this investigation. Soca, now rebranded as the National Crime Agency (NCA), said at the time that the operation had stopped a huge amount of cocaine from reaching the streets of the UK. Ms Bolton's new evidence has been passed to the criminal cases review commission, which will decide if the five men can launch a fresh appeal. She believes there was a motive for Soca to implicate the five men. \"At this stage in the investigation it appears Operation Disorient really needed to get a result. They had committed a lot of resources to this investigation and needed someone to be responsible, and they started focusing on the fishing boat. \"From then on, they interpreted all evidence that came before them as pointing to guilt, and meanwhile ignored or didn't seek other evidence which pointed in the opposite direction.\" The NCA said it could not comment while that investigation was ongoing. Hampshire Police said: \"It would not be appropriate to comment on operational matters led by another agency [the NCA].\"", "question": "In 2011 , a group of men from the Isle of Wight was given a @placeholder 104 - year prison sentence for masterminding a \u00a3 53 m drug smuggling operation .

{"article": "The girl suffered injuries including burns to her hands and feet, the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences has said. Police told the BBC the girl had worked for Islamabad judge Raja Khurram Ali Khan for the past two years. He has not yet commented. The case has caused a furore in Pakistan. Human rights groups say Pakistan's labour laws ignore the abuse of children who, from a young age, are working on the streets or in the homes of middle-class families. There are believed to be about 12 million child workers in Pakistan, many enduring unsafe or harsh conditions. Reports of the alleged abuse first surfaced on social media last month, along with pictures of the girl's injuries. Pakistan's mainstream media took up the story, after which the girl - whom the BBC is not naming - is said to have gone missing. Police are reported to have found her in a suburb of Islamabad on Sunday and taken her into protective custody. A report on the girl's injuries is to be submitted to the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Dr Tariq Iqbal, who heads the medical board, told reporters on Monday that she had \"some burns, some traumas, some lacerations, some blisters [on her body]\". \"We have documented all wounds and injuries in as much detail as possible, and have also given our opinion on the probable cause,\" he said. Last week, the girl's parents reportedly filed a statement in court saying that the allegations in the media were \"baseless\", and that they had \"reached a settlement\" with the judge and his family. Mr Iqbal said the girl had been changing her statements regarding how she acquired the injuries but added: \"She is only a child and our job is to get to the bottom of this affair.\" The girl is originally from a village in the Faisalabad region of Punjab province, police say.", "question": "A girl aged 10 who worked as a maid for a Pakistani judge shows signs of having been @placeholder , a medical board says .", "option_0": "accessed", "option_1": "tortured", "option_2": "halted", "option_3": "murdered", "option_4": "stabbed", "label": 1}
{"article": "In Moscow there have been fewer election posters and banners on view than in previous years. Last week one Russian newspaper joked that the Duma election had been classified \"Top Secret\", since voters did not know the names of the candidates. And yet, in theory, this election should have been more exciting than previous polls. A change to the law has permitted more parties to participate than in 2011 and even a handful of Kremlin critics have been allowed to run. What's more, this time half of the 450 Russian MPs will be elected - not by party lists - but in single-mandate districts: the return to a system in which Russians can vote for a candidate of their choice in their own constituency. However, the timing of this vote has kept public interest low. The Duma election had been scheduled for December. Instead the authorities brought it forward by three months, closer to the summer. As a result, Russians have been more concerned with holidays, harvesting fruits and vegetables on their allotments and preparing for the new school year than with electing a new Duma. But why the date change? How might the Kremlin benefit from a September, rather than a December, vote? Kremlin critics claim the aim was to ensure that urban populations - traditionally, more critical of the government - had less time in which to mobilise for the election. A lower turnout is widely believed to benefit the ruling party. President Putin will want the new Duma to be just as pro-Kremlin as previous incarnations. Even if the party of power - United Russia - fails to achieve an outright majority, the three other main \"systemic opposition\" parties (the Communists, Just Russia and the Liberal Democratic Party) should secure enough support to ensure the Duma remains, to a large extent, a Kremlin rubber stamp. But this time, the Kremlin needs a parliament, which is more than just a rubber stamp. It needs a Duma which is seen by the people to be a legitimate institution. The 2011 parliamentary vote was followed by anti-government street protests across Russia, sparked by what was widely perceived to have been large-scale electoral fraud: a rigged election in favour of United Russia. The protests were the biggest challenge Vladimir Putin had faced, although they waned after a Kremlin crackdown and differences among the opposition. To head off protests this time, the Kremlin will be keen to ensure this election is not tainted by accusations of vote-rigging. Hence, the changes to the election law, the inclusion of some opposition candidates, as well as the appointment of a respected human rights advocate, Ella Pamfilova, to head the Central Election Commission. That does not mean the current electoral process is beyond criticism - as I have suggested, the decision to change the date of the election appears an attempt to influence the result. Russia's economic problems make the need for legitimacy even more pressing. Eight years ago, the country's national reserve fund stood at $140bn (\u00c2\u00a3105bn). Last week, Russia's deputy finance minister predicted the reserve would be exhausted in 2017. That means more difficulties in paying social benefits, pensions and the salaries of state employees. The government may have no choice soon but to embark on unpopular economic reforms. This has implications for the vertical system of power Vladimir Putin has constructed in Russia, with the president at the top and all other institutions - including parliament - below and subservient to him. That system worked while the economy was working. But the money is running out, social protest is on the rise. The danger for the Kremlin is that if Russians question the legitimacy of other institutions in their country - including their parliament - they pin all of their too many hopes on the one man at the top.", "question": "This Sunday 's parliamentary election is the eighth which I have witnessed or @placeholder on in Russia since 1989 .

The 29-year-old former rugby league player denied he had bitten Waller, arguing that he had twisted his head after the player's arm was lodged in his mouth in a ruck.

Bailey, of Ynysybwl, Rhondda Cynon Taff, was jailed for 13 years after the pair were found guilty of conspiracy to rape. The offences came to light when the woman's partner found the texts. The court heard the pair exchanged dozens of messages and the woman also sent Bailey a naked picture of the girl and bought sleeping pills to drug her. At an earlier hearing, the woman admitted distributing five indecent images of a child and Bailey admitted possessing those images. The mother, described as \"vulnerable and gullible\" by recorder Eleri Rees QC, asked Bailey what she would get out of the plan to rape her daughter and he mentioned sums of \u00c2\u00a3200 to \u00c2\u00a3300. Judge Rees said Bailey was \"prolific\" in contacting a number of women on a dating website. An investigation discovered that he was having similar discussions with other women. The court heard the pair planned to rape the girl during the Whitsun school holiday and talked about drugging her. Judge Rees said that despite speaking to her doctor, who advised against giving a child sleeping tablets, the mother went ahead and bought some online. \"By your own admission you tried it out a week before the rape was due to take place,\" she added. Alex Greenwood, defending the mother, said she had been \"bullied, cajoled and blackmailed\" by Bailey. Lucy Crowther, defending Bailey, said her client was \"totally ashamed of his behaviour and his actions\".

{"article": "Hungary will propose that each of the 28 EU members pays 1% of its income from the Union, plus 1% of its contributions to it, into a special fund. In Hungary's case, that would amount to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn (\u00c2\u00a3720m; $1.1bn). Close to 250,000 migrants have entered Hungary this year - 70,000 this month alone - and it has become a transit state on the Western Balkan route to Germany and other EU destinations. The government has tried to stop migrants coming by erecting a border fence and giving the army extra powers to keep them out. And, along with three other Central European states, Hungary has been outvoted on an EU quota plan for taking in another 120,000 refugees. The proposed special fund would be used, Mr Orban will argue, to improve conditions in the refugee camps in countries neighbouring Syria - especially Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan - and to bolster Europe's external borders. Orban: Europe's borders threatened by migrants Why EU deal on migrants is so tricky Why Central Europe says No The Hungarian plan rests on two premises. That European voters share his view that the ongoing influx would change Europe beyond recognition, if allowed to continue, and that they don't want that. And that if conditions improve where they are, the migrants will stay there, in the hope that they can one day rebuild Syria. The Hungarian prime minister clearly also hopes that the plan will prove his own fence-building approach right - that Europe should defend its borders first, before it even starts discussing quotas. He may also add that Hungary would be willing to accept a voluntary quota, if his proposal or parts of it are accepted. The Orban proposal may be too much, too late for other European leaders. Despite fierce anti-migrant rhetoric and an ever-lengthening border fence, the Budapest government has failed to stop the influx of migrants, other EU leaders may point out.

Their lawyer claimed they are suffering state discrimination as a result of the ban. Judgement was reserved after a two-day hearing at the High Court in Belfast. Grainne Close, Shannon Sickles and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane challenged Stormont as the only UK administration to ban same-sex marriage. Belfast was the first place in the UK to host civil partnership ceremonies when the law was introduced 10 years ago, but now Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK and Ireland that has not legalised same-sex marriage. The two couples took the judicial review proceedings, claiming that the ban breaches Article Eight of European Convention on Human Rights, by denying respect for their private and family lives. But a lawyer for Stormont's Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) told the court the ban was not a breach of human rights. He added that civil partnerships already met the minimum requirements set out under human rights law. He told the court that recent rulings from the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights supported the view that no significant breach has occurred. Last month, in the fifth Stormont vote on the issue, MLAs backed the introduction of same-sex marriage for the first time, but the Democratic Unionist Party blocked it by deploying a mechanism requiring the proposal to achieve a cross-community majority.

{"article": "Vast yellow fields surround this border town. But just across the border inside Syria, white and black plumes of smoke rise above Kobane as Islamic State attacks intensify. In the past two weeks, thousands of women have managed to escape IS and take refuge in Turkey, only a few kilometres from their own homes. Their children have been queuing to register for entry into a new country. With rucksacks strapped to their backs, they could be schoolchildren queuing to begin a new term, were it not for the tragic circumstances. One man carries bright yellow birds in two cages. It seems everyone's priorities differ when it comes to deciding what to take with them. On my first day in Suruc, I had hoped to be back home in Istanbul in a matter of days. But the plight of the refugees and the stories I heard kept me at the border. I realised I would be staying longer than I had expected. I met a man who had lost his leg to a landmine. He was trying to escape from IS when he stepped on it right on the Syria-Turkey border. Once agricultural land, the Turkish authorities had turned it into a vast minefield in the 1950s to prevent smuggling. The same day I met a 19-year-old female Syrian Kurd YPG fighter in the main hospital in Urfa. She told me she had been shot by an IS extremist in a ditch in a village near Kobane.  She had shot back. She looked devoid of emotion as she told her story, and I saw her eyes light up only when I asked her to tell me more about her village. One day at the border, a group of young Kurdish men were tear-gassed by Turkish police as they tried to get home to fight with the YPG. Most of them made it through. I then spoke to a woman nearby. Her name was Amira. She had three small children with her.  She was sitting on a rock, refusing to move, she said, until it was safe for her to return home. Her youngest boy was crying silently. That night, I heard there were American air strikes. Earlier, some of the Kurdish refugees and local residents had told me the air intervention filled them with hope. Others refused to believe the strikes had actually happened. \"It is all lies. No way were there any US air strikes near Kobane that night,\" they had told me. The next day some of the refugees went back across the border to Kobane. Still at the border, I remember one elderly woman in a purple dress, probably in her 70s.  She said she longed for home and wanted to die there.  She pointed at the small stones on at her feet. \"I sleep on this ground, just like these stones do. But I want to die in the comfort of my own bed.\" A few hours later at this same spot, I saw a hearse carrying the coffin of a dead fighter, who had been brought to Turkey for treatment after suffering injuries in the fighting in Kobane.  A terrible ending, I thought. In Suruc, a few days later, Hennan Muhammed told me how IS had taken his son hostage while he was travelling to Iraq to avoid being conscripted by Syria in the war. His son was an English literature graduate, just like me. Half way through my trip, a mortar shell landed near the TV satellite trucks stationed on the Turkish side of the border. Luckily no-one got hurt.  But the sound of it was unforgettable, so dangerous and so close. I filmed a piece-to-camera as safely as I could. When my recorded video appeared on the BBC Turkish website later that day, I did not post the link on Facebook so my mother would not find out and worry.

{"article": "The Ozo features eight camera lenses and eight microphones on a spherical-shaped body, from which a handle protrudes. The Finnish firm said that one advantage over existing systems was that it created footage that could be watched in real time via a VR headset. One expert said Ozo was not as big a leap for the firm as it might seem. \"Nokia has a great deal of experience developing not only camera technology, but also the portability of camera technology,\" said Chris Green, a consultant at Davies Murphy Group. \"The company was putting in high-end cameras on very small mobile phones and producing exceptional image results years before other manufacturers. \"And it can now direct the knowledge it has to other sectors.\" Ozo was unveiled at an event in Los Angeles, underlining that the company plans to target it at Hollywood and other media professionals, rather than consumers. Nokia said the device was due to go on sale before the end of the year, but was unable to provide the full technical specifications or price. Nokia follows GoPro, Jaunt, Giroptic and Spherical in announcing a virtual reality recording device that is meant for \"prosumers\". The firm's pitch is that  Ozo can not only provide live monitoring of footage via a compatible headset, but also allow playback of filmed material at low resolution within minutes of it being shot. \"[It] removes the need to pre-assemble a panoramic image - a time-consuming process with solutions currently in the marketplace,\" the company said in a statement. One tech journalist who was given a preview of a prototype suggested the footage it produced was sometimes \"muddy and out of focus\" but praised the kit's audio-rendering capabilities. \"I found myself constantly looking around in each clip, because the sound seemed to track my position,\" wrote Casey Newton for the Verge. \"I would hear something behind me, and when I turned I would see the still-moving mouth of the person talking.\" Nokia also revealed that Jaunt would support its device, despite the Californian company offering a rival product of its own called Neo. Jaunt's investors include Britain's Sky TV and Google, and its president Cliff Plumer was an adviser to the Oculus VR headset's creators before they joined Facebook - making the firm well placed to capitalise on growing interest in VR. \"Our partnership with Nokia is another big step for us to continue to provide our partners with the most cutting-edge technology to further cater to their creative needs,\" said Mr Plumer. Virtual reality is unlikely to become Nokia's main business. Earlier this week, the European Union approved the company's 15.6bn euro ($17.2bn; \u00c2\u00a311bn) takeover of Alcatel-Lucent, which will let it extend its share of the telecoms network equipment market. But Mr Green said Ozo still had the potential to develop into a sizeable business. \"We know there is a market there - the fact VR cameras are already being used in professional film and TV production shows the importance they now have,\" he said. \"There's room for lots more growth, and it's a logical market for Nokia to dabble in.\"", "question": "Nokia is developing a virtual - reality @placeholder device that can record 360 - degree views and \" 3D audio \" .", "option_0": "dollar", "option_1": "body", "option_2": "capture", "option_3": "group", "option_4": "partnership", "label": 2}

That's because politicians have repeatedly failed to agree on a new government since the first of two inconclusive general elections was held on 20 December 2015. In the words of Spanish analyst Francisco de Borja Lasheras: \"We are learning to be Belgium but the question remains whether the Spanish state can afford to be Belgium.\" \"We Spaniards are used to our politicians doing a botch job so such a situation is not completely unexpected,\" says Mario Perales, a 45-year-old civil servant from Madrid. And his view is largely shared by Spaniards: one recent poll suggested only 11.6% saw a lack of government as their biggest problem. So will the limbo last? Spain's Socialist party (PSOE) national committee meets on Sunday to decide whether to stand aside and allow caretaker Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to govern without a majority in parliament. If they don't, Spain's power vacuum rolls on towards a third national election, probably on 18 December. A caretaker government is a lame-duck government. Foreign and economic policy comes to a halt and lawmaking stops. Belgium's 541-day stalemate lasted from 13 June 2010 to 6 December 2011. Its borrowing costs soared and its credit score was cut.

Both countries face a separatist challenge, from some Flemish parties in Belgium and Catalan groups in north-eastern Spain. Both are constitutional monarchies. Spain has seen six prime ministers since it returned to democratic rule in 1977, while Belgium has changed leader 12 times in the same period. Will Spain's lost months come to an end? Spain's Socialist leader resigns Belgium country profile For Spain's deadlock to end, the Socialists would have to agree to hold their noses, abstain in a confidence vote and let Mariano Rajoy return to power at the head of a centre-right government. His Popular Party (PP) government has been marked by corruption scandals and austerity measures. Allowing his return was too much to bear for Pedro Sanchez, who resigned as Socialist leader rather than let that happen. Tensions have run high between politicians, but the Spanish population has barely stirred. In Belgium, during the 18-month deadlock, protests included a shaving stoppage and even the suggestion of a sex strike by male politicians' wives. Not so in Spain. \"Spaniards are very tolerant on the whole, and our political bickering has not trickled down yet to the population,\" says Francisco de Borja Lasheras, from the European Council of Foreign Relations (ECFR). \"There are levels of government that are working perfectly well,\" he says, but warns that in the long term, Catalonia's drive towards independence and foreign challenges such as Brexit will need a proper government. The reality is that Spain is functioning, and largely thanks to its regions. Unlike Madrid's national parliament, almost all 17 regional governments which run health, education and other public services are formed by a variety of coalitions from across the political spectrum. But the national budget is the job of central government and no new policies can be drawn up for 2017. Although Spain's economy has maintained a steady pace of growth of just over 3% annually since early 2015, the budget deficit is still well above target. So this year's spending plan will be automatically rolled over. \"This means we cannot take on any new expense, reform or investment that is not already detailed in the rolled-over budget,\" a government spokesperson explains. The caretaker government had to secure the support of parliament to avoid EU sanctions on its 2016 deficit target. But there is no deal yet to reduce the deficit in 2017, as Brussels demands. The parties may be bickering nationally, but regionally it's a different story. Madrid's PP regional president, Cristina Cifuentes, signed an anti-corruption agreement to secure the support of the centrist Ciudadanos party in 2015, including an end to parliamentarians' immunity from prosecution. Andalucia's Socialist president, Susana Diaz, also made a deal with Ciudadanos. In Valencia, the government led by Socialist Ximo Puig, backed by anti-austerity parties Compromis and Podemos, budgeted a record \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13.3 (\u00c2\u00a311.9bn; $14.5bn) billion for spending on health, education, housing and social inclusiveness in 2016. In Catalonia, a parliamentary majority of pro-independence parties has voted in favour of a new Catalan state and is about to pass a law creating the region's own tax office.

{"article": "Wigan made a great start as, triggered by young debutant James Worthington's early try, the hosts went 20-0 up in 20 minutes, Lewis Tierney, Liam Marshall and Tommy Leuluai all crossing too. But Bill Tupou's 11-minute hat-trick saw Trinity go 22-20 up at half-time. Danny Kirmond, Liam Finn, who kicked six goals, and Jacob Miller all added to Mason Caton-Brown's first-half try. The transformation came when Wakefield responded to the concession of Wigan's fourth try by bringing on Anthony England and David Fifita to give more power to the visitors' pack. But they could not have envisaged quite such a turnaround as, from Tupou's first touchdown in the 25th minute, followed by Caton-Brown, the big winger bagged two more to double his try tally for the season to six by the 36th minute. Finn, whose conversion of Tupou's hat-trick try gave Trinity the lead for the first time, missed just once, although allowed the luxury of a rare re-taken conversion to Miller's late try. Centre Worthington and winger Marshall, who took his tally to 16 for the season, both added a second try after the break. But George Williams landed only two of his conversion attempts, prompting a late change of kicker to Marshall, to exacerbate Wigan's woes as they suffered a fourth home defeat of the season. They remain a distant eight points off top spot, while Wakefield, up into fourth, remain six points behind leaders Castleford, who won comfortably at Leigh. Wakefield had lost on all their previous eight visits to Wigan, but it is only 13 months since they ran in 11 tries on home soil at Belle Vue to win 62-0, their record win against Wigan. Wigan boss Shaun Wane revealed that Joe Burgess and Joel Tomkins have a chance of playing at Hull on Saturday, while Liam Forsyth will be in contention after missing the game with a head knock. But the only real positive he took was the two tries for 20-year-old former Wigan St Judes junior Worthington, who scored with his first touch on his first start for his home-town club. Wigan coach Shaun Wane: \"Wigan teams should never be giving up a 20-0 lead, no matter what. But no excuses from us. We were beaten by the better team. \"We were a bit out of juice. They are a big team. We came into it a bit lethargic and you just have to try and manage their big bodies. \"We gave a few penalties away and just didn't make those one-on-one tackles. We fell apart and missed too many one-on-ones. We made some poor defensive errors and put ourselves under pressure. \"James Worthington is a Wigan kid. I only told him he was playing on Sunday and he was very nervous. To score with his first touch was fantastic. He made a couple of defensive errors but took his tries really well.\" Wakefield coach Chris Chester: \"For the first 20 minutes, we couldn't control the ball. We were completing at 50 per cent. Then, from 20 minutes we went 11 sets from 11. \"We were worthy winners. It was a top performance. That Wakefield team 12 months ago would have been done by a cricket score, so I'm really pleased we came back in the game and got a massive result for this club. \"It's a hard place to come.

{"article": "Lebanon now has \"the highest per capita concentration of refugees worldwide\", said the head of the UN refugee agency. \"For Lebanon, a small nation beset by internal difficulties, the impact is staggering,\" he added. About 9.5 million people, almost half of Syria's population, have fled their homes since the start of the conflict. More than 2.5 million have fled the country, with large numbers being taken in by Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt and others. However Lebanon is bearing the biggest burden of all - the number of Syrian refugees there now amount to a quarter of the local population. By Jim MuirBBC News, Beirut Everybody knows that the real number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon is already well past the million mark, but the fact that that many have now been officially registered is yet another grim milestone as the conflict grinds on. Lebanon's the smallest and most vulnerable of Syria's neighbours, yet it's taken in by far the largest number of refugees - one for every four of the country's own people. That's a huge strain - the foreign minister said last month that it threatened Lebanon's very existence, and it's growing all the time, with about 2,500 new refugees being registered every day. The UN has only received 14% of the funding it's asked for. That means that relief has to be cut back and carefully targeted to the most needy. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says this is a huge strain for Lebanon, the smallest and most vulnerable of Syria's neighbours. Last month the Lebanese foreign minister said the crisis was \"threatening the existence\" of his country. \"The Lebanese people have shown striking generosity, but are struggling to cope,\" Mr Guterres said. The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, notes that the influx of refugees is accelerating. \"Every day, UNHCR in Lebanon registers 2,500 new refugees: more than one person a minute,\" the agency said in a statement. International aid agencies are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the flow of refugees. UNHCR has only received 14% of the $6.5bn (\u00c2\u00a34bn; 4.7bn euros) funding it has asked for. The hardships many refugees are facing was dramatically highlighted last week when a mother with a sick husband and four children set fire to herself in protest at not receiving help. She was critically injured. The civil war in Syria between Sunni-led rebels and the government of Bashar al-Assad has also fuelled sectarian tensions in Lebanon, which has a large Sunni and Shia Muslim population.

{"article": "It is a scene the 79-year-old priest says he knows well. For the past 27 years, Fr Taraborelli has performed exorcisms - the Catholic rite of expelling evil spirits. He stumbled into the job when a fellow priest needed help. \"I didn't know what it was, I hadn't studied it,\" the father says. \"He told me what to do. I was totally ignorant.\" He has since become one of Rome's busiest exorcists, and the Catholic Church is struggling to find younger successors. Working three days a week from a windowless room at the back of his church near the Vatican, he often sees up to 30 people every day. \"Before doing exorcisms I urge people to see a psychologist or a psychiatrist, and I ask them to bring me their prognosis. I'm in touch with many psychologists who send their patients here.\" Vatican denies Pope performed exorcism The country where exorcisms are on the rise Arrests after woman dies in 'exorcism ritual' in Germany On one side of the room, a cabinet is filled with hundreds of small statues of angels. In a drawer, he keeps a supply of sweets to hand out to his visitors. On the wall is an official document showing his qualification as an exorcist. Fr Taraborelli's desk is crowded with papers, photos, and prayer books. He sits in a simple chair; those who come to see him sit opposite him. Before doing exorcisms I urge people to see a psychologist or a psychiatrist. I ask them to bring me their prognosis.\" \"First of all, I get the room ready,\" he says. \"Then if the person is not doing well, I try to calm them down reassure them. I invite them to join me in prayer. But many of them when they come here are already disturbed.\" He looks through his copy of the Catholic Church's exorcism rites. He's had to tape it back together to stop it from falling apart. Amidst the pile of papers on his desk, he finds the cross he uses to expel evil spirits. His most notable case involved a married woman he treated for 13 years. \"Another man, who was a Satanist, wanted her,\" he remembers. \"She refused. So this man told her: 'You'll pay for this.' He cast so-called spells to attract her to him, twice a week. \"Then they came to me, in this room. I started to pray, and she went into a trance. She would blurt out insults, blasphemies. I quickly understood she was possessed. \"As the rite continued, she started feeling worse and worse. So when I told the devil: 'In the name of Jesus, I order you to go away', she started to vomit little metal pins, five at a time. \"Aside from pins she would also vomit hair braids, little stones, pieces of wood. It sounds like something from another world right? Instead, it's something from this world.\" Within the Catholic Church, the concept of possession by demons is an accepted belief. It is sometimes used to explain murderous behaviour, as in the recent murder of 85-year-old French priest Fr Jacques Hamel in his church in the French city of Rouen in July. Survivor tells of priest's murder What we know of Church attack When two Islamist militants acting in the name of jihadist group Islamic State (IS) burst into the church and stabbed Fr Hamel, he tried to fend them off, crying out \"Be gone, Satan!\" - an apparent attempt at exorcism. In support of the priest's actions, Pope Francis accelerated the process of Fr Hamel's candidacy for sainthood. But outside the Catholic Church, many dispute the entire basis of demonic possession and exorcism. Non-believers argue that so-called possession by evil spirits is simply a medieval superstition or myth. Those who claim to be possessed by evil spirits are people suffering from easily explicable psychological or psychiatric problems, they say. Fr Taraborelli rejects the scepticism. \"Well, someone who isn't a believer doesn't believe in the devil either,\" he says, \"But someone who believes knows that the devil exists, you can read it in the gospel. Then you only need to see how the world is nowadays. It has never been this bad. These violence acts are not human. So terrible, like IS.\" Fr Taraborelli shows no sign of wanting to give up his work and his mobile phone rings constantly. But younger priests are not particularly attracted by the prospect of spending hours in windowless rooms, reading exorcism rites to disturbed believers. \"I told the bishop that I can't find anyone willing to do this. Many of them are scared. Even priests can be scared. It's a difficult life.\"", "question": "\" That is a possessed woman there , \" says Fr Vincenzo Taraborelli as he points up to an 18th Century fresco in his Roman church . \" They 're holding her with her mouth open .

It also found complimentary environmentally friendly solutions that minimise the amount of fresh rain water entering the sewerage system should be considered.

People looted shops, vandalised cars and stores, and set a building alight as police tried to block off access to several areas of the city. Police say Michael Brown, 18, was shot on Saturday afternoon in the mainly black suburb of St Louis. He was shot several times after a struggle in a police car, they said. On Monday, dozens of residents marched through the streets demanding justice. As residents began the task of cleaning up, some said they believed the violence was not over. DeAndre Smith, 30, of Ferguson told the St Louis Post-Dispatch that the rioting reflected a sense of injustice in the community. \"I don't think it's over honestly,\" he said. \"I just think they got a taste of what fighting back means.\" St Louis County police say the FBI has now taken over the investigation into Mr Brown's death. The rioting erupted late on Sunday after thousands of people attended a candlelight vigil for the slain man. County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting occurred after the officer encountered two men, including Mr Brown, on a street in Ferguson. Mr Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. At least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car, Mr Belmar said. But authorities say they are still trying to clarify exactly what happened inside the vehicle. The officer involved has been with the Ferguson police department for six years, and has been placed on paid administrative leave, Mr Belmar said.

Rosberg hoped governing body the FIA had stuck to the safety guidelines that govern tracks, but added: \"I'm doubting it a little because of those corners.\" The main areas of concern on the new track, which joins both the new and historic old parts of the city and is expected to be the fastest street circuit in F1 history, are turns three, seven and 15 and the pit-lane entry. Button said: \"We trust in the FIA and they do a fantastic job in keeping us safe. They have improved pretty much every circuit we go to, including Monaco. \"It's just that on certain corners here, it looks as if there is not a lot of run-off. Hopefully I'm wrong.\" He added: \"It is fine as long as no-one has a failure, we will go away all happy. We just have to hope that doesn't happen.\" Button said the most critical area was turn 15, which the drivers will approach at estimated speeds of about 180mph after a long flat-out section. He said: \"There is run-off but you have to turn right to take it.\" Rosberg added: \"The track is great, the place is great. I have been welcomed very well so I'm sure all in all it will be a great success. \"But there is a bit of a concern for sure with those run-offs. That's not great. The corner before going down the hill (15) where you have a wall straight on, turn three, and then the pit entry as well. that is not fantastic.\" The pit-lane entry is towards the end of a 2.1-kilometre straight, where cars are expected to be travelling in excess of 200mph, and features a tight chicane. The area governed by the pit-lane speed limit does not start until after the chicane. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo said the pit entry \"is going to be quite cool\" because, as it is effectively part of the race track, there was \"between half-a-second and a second\" for a driver to gain in the chicane. But Rosberg countered: \"Yeah but there is also a massive accident to be had if you go a little bit more than that.\" McLaren's two-time champion Fernando Alonso, who is the race's official ambassador, played down the issue. \"There are some corners probably we will talk about,\" he said. \"Some others that we need to go on the car first and see how they feel. \"In terms of safety, the FIA ran many simulations in terms of how to make the run-off safe enough.

{"article": "Pepsi apologised and pulled the ad after accusations that it trivialised recent street protests across the US. But it wasn't the only company copping flak for poor creativity this week. German skincare brand Nivea also said sorry over its \"white is purity\" deodorant advert that was deemed discriminatory and racially insensitive. Meanwhile, in the UK, the Co-op supermarket was accused of \"outrageous sexism\" in an advert for chocolate Easter eggs that encouraged parents to \"treat your daughter for doing the washing up\", while Cadbury was criticised after dropping the word \"Easter\" from its egg hunts. These campaigns have now taken their place in the pantheon of bad advertising. Here are a few more picks from recent memory. Here's another one that left a sour taste. The Snickers TV advert featuring Mr T as BA Baracus from The A-Team was pulled after it was accused of being insulting to gay men. Mr T is shown firing Snickers chocolate bars at a man who's speed walking in tight yellow shorts, while yelling, \"You are a disgrace to the man race. It's time to run like a real man.\" Confectionery giant Mars, which owns Snickers, released a statement saying the advert was intended to be funny but that \"humour is highly subjective\". In the US and most of the West, this poster would have caused outrage and accusations of racism. But in Thailand, an image of a woman in blackface and bright pink lipstick to promote a new \"charcoal donut\" wasn't deemed a big deal. The chief executive of the Thai franchise - whose daughter was the model - reportedly said at the time: \"I don't get it. What's the big fuss? What if the product was white and I painted someone white, would that be racist?\" But a spokesman for Dunkin' Brands apologised. The use of blackface - which historically was used by non-black performers to represent a black person - is still used in some Asian countries. Last year, a company in China used it to promote a laundry detergent. The US carmaker was forced to issue an apology over a poster that featured three gagged and bound women in the boot of a car. It also showed former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in the driver's seat grinning and flashing the peace sign. The advert for Ford's new Fido hatchback was posted online soon after India passed a new law on violence against women following a fatal gang rape. This anti-gambling advert deserves to be ranked in the Hall of Fame (or shame) for the amount of jokes it generated. It was released to coincide with the 2014 World Cup and featured a boy complaining to friends that his dad had bet his life savings on Germany winning. The trouble is... Germany won. Singapore officials updated the ad but not before it got lampooned around the world. It takes quite a lot to shock in France, a country many consider to be one of the most liberal in Europe. But a 2010 anti-smoking advertisement featuring teenagers and oral sex innuendos did just that, with one minister calling it an \"outrage to decency\". Critics said the highly suggestive pictures trivialised the sexual abuse of minors. Thankfully we've since moved on to pictures of diseased organs to put people off smoking instead. There wasn't any cheering when the US department store Bloomingdale's released its Christmas catalogue two years ago. The photo of an attractive, well-dressed woman being eyeballed by an unsmiling man looked innocent enough... Until you read the creepy caption that said \"spike your best friend's eggnog when they're not looking\". The online backlash was swift with many interpreting it as supporting date rape. Bloomingdale's admitted the ad was \"in poor taste\". Benetton's \"Unhate\" campaign (which still exists) had good intentions when it launched in 2011. But on one of its images the Italian clothing company clearly took its photo-editing skills too far. It received a warning and the threat of legal action from the Vatican for a \"totally unacceptable\" image of Pope Benedict XVI kissing an Egyptian imam, and subsequently withdrew the ad. The Vatican said in a statement that the ad was \"damaging not only to the dignity of the Pope and the Catholic Church but also to the feelings of believers\". The White House also disapproved of the images featuring then-President Barack Obama but Benetton kept those. We live in a time where race and gender and sexual orientation remain highly sensitive topics. So what can brands do to generate buzz without offending? David Meikle, who founded marketing consultancy Salt, doubts that Pepsi will suffer from any long-term damage from the Kendall Jenner ad fiasco. \"Pepsi seems to have managed the retraction and apology quite well. Most importantly Pepsi was swift and decisive in its response to the feedback,\" he says. Simon Kemp, a marketing expert with almost two decades of experience, agrees that Pepsi has handled the fallout well but says all eyes will be on its next campaign. \"I think Pepsi has built sufficient goodwill over the years that their core customers will forgive them this time, although they may not forget as quickly as the brand would like. The real test will come when the brand launches its next campaign though, and Pepsi will need to tread carefully for that.\" Share your thoughts and follow Leisha on Twitter.", "question": "An advert released by drinks giant Pepsi and @placeholder reality TV star and model Kendall Jenner has left a bad taste around the world .", "option_0": "starring", "option_1": "isolated", "option_2": "raised", "option_3": "conditions", "option_4": "print", "label": 0}
{"article": "Mr Kerry said there would be \"repercussions\" if the Syrian government flouted a cessation of violence agreed in February. A resurgence in fighting, particularly in the northern city of Aleppo, has threatened to derail the partial truce. More than 250 people have been killed in Aleppo in the past 10 days. As diplomatic efforts intensified on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a unilateral truce declared by the Syrian military could be extended to Aleppo \"in the next few hours\". After talks with UN envoy Staffan de Mistura in Moscow, he said Russia was working with the UN and US to include Aleppo in the \"regime of calm\" that has covered Damascus and Latakia since Saturday. On Tuesday, 19 people were killed by rebel rocket fire in government-controlled areas of Aleppo, monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. State media said a hospital was hit, killing three people and wounding 17. Last Wednesday, an air strike on a hospital in a rebel-held area killed 55 people. The US blamed the attack on government forces. Speaking in Washington, Mr Kerry said he was hopeful the cessation of violence could be restored, and he warned President Assad of consequences if violations continued. \"If Assad does not adhere to this, there will clearly be repercussions, and one of them may be the total destruction of the ceasefire and then go back to war. I don't think Russia wants that,\" he said. Mr Kerry added: \"If Assad's strategy is to somehow think he's going to just carve out Aleppo and carve out a section of the country, I've got news for him - this war doesn't end. \"It is simply physically impossible for Assad to just carve out an area and pretend that he's somehow going to make it safe, while the underlying issues are unresolved in this war. And as long as Assad is there, the opposition is not going to stop fighting it... one way or the other.\" He reiterated there was an August deadline for starting a political transition in Syria. Earlier this year, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned that Russia might be trying to create a mini-state for President Assad in the north-west of the country, which includes Aleppo. Russia strongly denied the idea. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Lavrov told reporters that he expected a decision on including Aleppo in the separate regime of calm \"in the very near future - maybe in the next few hours\". The unilateral truce had been effect in Latakia and the eastern Ghouta region around Damascus since the weekend thanks to the efforts of the Russian and US militaries, he said. The aim of Russian, US and UN negotiators was to extend the regime of calm and \"ideally make it indefinite\", Mr Lavrov added. But he warned that so-called moderate rebel groups in Aleppo had to leave areas where militants from al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate that is excluded from the cessation of hostilities, were being targeted. The partial halt in fighting has raised hopes that tentative peace talks in Geneva might bring forward a solution to Syria's bloody five-year civil war. But the truce all but collapsed after renewed violence, particularly in Aleppo. Also on Tuesday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding the protection of hospitals, clinics and health workers in war zones. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said there was no justification for attacks on medical facilities.

{"article": "UCAS announced earlier this year that there had been a notable decrease in students from England applying to do at least one nursing course, saying it had fallen 23% to 33,810 in 2017. Chancellor Philip Hammond spoke last week about the \"very high numbers of foreign workers keeping our NHS going\". Looking at the figures from NHS Digital, overall, 82% of NHS staff are UK nationals, with 5% from the European Economic Area (EEA, that's the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and 6% from the rest of the world. The remaining 7% are of unknown nationalities. The unknowns are relatively high because they come from electronic staff records, not HR information, and it is not compulsory for staff to declare their nationalities for those records. For doctors, it's 70% UK, 9% EEA, 16% from the rest of the world and 5% unknown. And for nurses and health visitors it is 78% UK, 7% EEA, 8% from the rest of the world and 6% unknown. To put that into context, according to the latest labour market figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 7.3% of workers in the UK are EU nationals while 3.9% are from the rest of the world. Clearly, the unknowns throw comparisons out a bit, but the proportion of NHS staff from the EEA appears to be a bit below the workforce as a whole while there are considerably more from the rest of the world than the workforce average. For doctors, there are proportionally more foreign nationals than in the workforce as a whole, especially for those from the rest of the world. If you look at the figures for where doctors earned their qualifications, the rest of the world comes even higher with 27%, compared with 64% from the UK and 9% from the EEA. Nurses from the EEA work in the NHS in the same proportion as the rest of the workforce while nurses from the rest of the world are overrepresented.

{"article": "Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says the party does not want to return to an era of widespread state ownership. Instead, Labour would look to expand co-operatives and explore giving workers the \"right to own\". David Cameron has accused Labour of wanting to turn back the clock to the days of state ownership and strikes. But Mr McDonnell tackled this claim head-on in a speech in Manchester, saying Labour had to move on from its traditional belief that state ownership was always the answer. \"Whatever the achievements of the past, we cannot simply turn the clock back - whether to 1997, 1964, or 1945,\" he said. At the last election, \"the Tories talked relentlessly, overwhelmingly about the future. Labour, strikingly, did not\". \"We cannot allow that to happen again. We cannot be small 'c' conservatives.\" He added: \"A future Labour government will end the current programme of spending cuts. We will protect what has already been won. \"But we must look beyond this point. We should be seizing the opportunity to create a fairer, more democratic society.\" Labour has already announced its intention to return the railways to public ownership. But when it comes to the wider economy, Mr McDonnell said Labour should \"look elsewhere\" for solutions, and draw on its tradition of supporting workers' co-operatives. He signalled support for giving employees in companies which are about to be sold off  - or floated on the stock exchange - the first option to purchase the company. \"The Tories have offered a Right to Buy, Labour would seek to better this. We'd be creating a new Right to Own,\" he said in a speech in Manchester. He said the \"biggest hurdle\" facing co-ops and other small businesses was getting initial funding from high street banks. \"No other major developed economy has just five banks providing 80% of loans. We'd look to break up these monopolies, introducing real competition and choice. \"Regional and local banks, prudently run and with a public service mandate, have to be part of the solution here.\" Mr McDonnell is also considering adopting the Italian government's policy of offering funding to help employee-owned enterprises to get off the ground. \"With consortium co-operatives providing an effective means for new businesses to share and reduce costs, we'd look to support these at a local level, working with local authorities, businesses and trade unions,\" he said. He said the policy would be developed \"over the next few years\", adding:  \"In an uncertain world where a laissez faire market approach continues to fail, co-operation is an idea whose time has come again. \"This is the start of developing a new, positive economic alternative for Labour.\" He also urged Labour to embrace opportunities offered by the internet and new technology. \"Technology is proving disruptive. It can have terrible downsides - de-skilling and an accelerated concentration of wealth. \"But it also opens up new possibilities - the explosion of sharing that the Internet can provide. \"There is an entrepreneurial spirit at work here: not the theatrical meanness and one-upmanship of Gordon Gekko, but a desire to create something better for us all.\" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Greg Hands said Labour represented \"a threat to our economic security\".

{"article": "Too often firms just react to what software flags on their network instead of actively hunting out intruders, says the security firm Mandiant. It says hackers get control of about 40 machines in the average breach. But, it adds, often only a handful of servers are typically cleaned up. The result, it says, is that attackers can linger on internal networks for months, giving them the opportunity to steal more information. \"Most companies have a very old-fashioned way of investigating a breach,\" said Bill Hau, an executive at Mandiant. He delivered his warning on the first day of Infosecurity Europe, an industry exhibition and conference in London. It is a booming time for the sector. Spending on cybersecurity totalled $77bn (\u00c2\u00a353bn) last year, and is forecast to grow to $170bn by 2020. Mandiant and other incident response firms often get called in when techniques based around traditional security tools have failed to find and remove all the loopholes through which hackers have slipped. \"That old-style technology makes them think they have remediated a breach but they might never have kicked the bad guys out in the first place,\" Mr Hau told the BBC. Often, he said, attackers can \"dwell\" in networks for months during which time they seek to get high level administration access so they can erase evidence of their presence and thwart investigations. \"Companies do not understand that they have to move to a different methodology to get these guys out,\" he said. \"They need to go and look for trouble and they will find it,\" he said. \"They have to hunt them out in their own networks.\" Patrick Grillo, a senior director at security firm Fortinet, agreed that many firms spent too much time securing the edges of their networks at the expense of looking more closely at what happens internally. \"The traditional network has been built with a very strong perimeter,\" he said. \"but if the malware gets beyond that its wide open. The network is soft and chewy on the inside. \"What the bad guys want to do is get in undetected and then be able to move laterally through the network until they reach their goal.\" Most intruders seek out saleable data such as credit card numbers or personal information about customers, he said.

The review will decide if refugees are able to stay in the UK or will return to their home country. The Home Office said it could not comment because of \"purdah\" rules. These limit government activity during the pre-election period. The department issued updated guidance on the process by which refugees already living in the UK apply to stay here permanently. Under the policy, all those who apply for settlement will be subject to a so-called \"safe return review\" to check the current situation in their home country. Campaigners claim the measures would \"put an end to hope of stability\" and end any possibility of refugees being able to integrate into society. Organisations that have signed the letter include Black Lives Matter UK, the Northern Ireland Community of Refugees and Asylum Seekers, the Scottish Refugee Council, Migrant Voice, Space4U Cardiff, Manchester Migrant Solidarity and Calais Action.

{"article": "The pop legend lost his cool during his performance at Gloucester's Kingsholm Stadium on Sunday. The steward incurred John's wrath for trying to stop people with cheaper tickets blocking the view of concert-goers at the front who had paid more. But sorry turned out not to be the hardest word, with John later getting her on stage and apologising. Stewards at the stadium, which is the home of Gloucester Rugby, were faced with the problem of some people moving to the front and blocking the view of others at the gig, which was supposed to be seated. The lack of crowd control has been criticised by fans, but promoter Marshall Arts, which was responsible for the stewarding, refused to comment about it. During the concert, the legendary singer-songwriter told the stewards to \"lighten up\". He told them: \"These people have come here to hear music so if they want to put their hands in the air, let them.\" In an expletive-laden rant, John went to say it was \"not China\" and he picked out a female steward, telling her: \"You put a uniform on and you think you're Hitler - well you're not.\" Moments later the woman could be seen on the big screen walking away from the stage area, while people cheered the Rocket Man writer's outburst. Steven Ward, from Tewkesbury, who attended the event, said: \"This [concert] was seated, there were disabled people who were sat on our aisle who couldn't see, obviously they couldn't stand up to see the stage. \"There were people fighting to get a view of what they were trying to look at and, for some reason, the stewards brought out barriers to try and stop people, but that made them worse because they congregated by the barrier.\" Gloucester Rugby's commercial manager, Mike Turner, said: \"The Elton John concert is a stadium hire so Elton brings on his own stewards. \"Our stewards man the corporate areas and everything else is manned by the production company Elton uses. \"The stewards did their best to bring the concert back to how it should be.\" A spokesman for Marshall Arts said the concert had been a great success but she would not comment on any aspect of the stewarding, which she said was subcontracted to another company.", "question": "Sir Elton John @placeholder a steward to Hitler as she tried to stop crowds from surging forward during a gig .", "option_0": "delivered", "option_1": "is", "option_2": "likened", "option_3": "launched", "option_4": "played", "label": 2}

{"article": "Two of them did not march to police lines at the junction of Woodvale Road and Woodvale Parade on 12 July, the point at which the Parades Commission said the parade must stop. In the previous three years, the Orange Order arrived in force, with hundreds of members, supporters and bandsmen. But, on Tuesday, fewer than 20 members of Ballysillan lodge, and a small number of supporters, arrived at a police barrier erected across the road. They clearly expected the other lodges to join them, and waited for an hour and a quarter for them to do so. The assembled media were told repeatedly by Orange, loyalist and police sources that Ligoniel True Blues and the Earl of Erne lodges were on their way. But they never came. At 20:30 BST, looking visibly frustrated, members of Ballysillan LOL 1891 walked away from police lines and dispersed. The lodge and the Orange Order have since rejected any suggestion it was deliberately left out on a limb for opposing a deal with a nationalist residents' group in Ardoyne to end the parade dispute. The proposed deal collapsed earlier this month after Ballysillan made it clear it would not back it, while the others said they would. Gerald Solinas, a spokesman for Ballysillan, said it was simply because the other lodges would not have made it to the police barrier before the 20:30 BST cut-off point imposed by the parades commission. The Orange Order has backed this claim and insisted what happened was not the result of a deliberate decision to isolate Ballysillan. But the BBC has established that a deliberate decision was taken to keep the three lodges apart. There are more than 100 lodges within Belfast County Grand Lodge Each of them is a member of one of nine districts. Traditionally all lodges within each district walk together. However, that has not happened in north Belfast since this disputed parade was prevented from completing its return leg past the Ardoyne shop fronts in July 2013. Since then, the three lodges involved in the dispute have marched together in solidarity, despite being members of different districts. Ballysillan LOL 1891 is member of District Number Three, Ligoniel True Blues LOL 1932 part of Number One, and the Earl of Erne LOL 647 is a member of District Number Four. In the three previous years the lodges were given special allowances by their governing body, Belfast County Grand Lodge, to walk together close to the head of the Twelfth parade. That changed this year. Instead, the lodges decided they would parade as part of their own districts, and not together. Each year one of the districts leads the parade. This year it was the turn of District Number Three, so Ballysillan helped lead the way. The other districts then followed in numerical order, with the Earl of Erne, District Number Four, directly behind them. Districts five, six, seven, eight and nine then followed, before going back to District Number One, which meant Ligoneil was towards the back of the parade. The Orange Order claim that the Earl of Erne and Ligoneil decided to disperse early because they ran out of time and could not make the police barriers before the 20:30 BST deadline imposed by the Parades Commission. That might stand up to scrutiny if both of the other lodges were together at the back of the parade. But they weren't. So how could it be that Ballysillan, which is part of District Number Three, reached the barrier on the Woodvale Road at 19:15 BST, while a lodge in the district immediately behind them could not make it an hour and a quarter later? An Orange Order source says members of the Earl of Erne lodge decided to wait for Ligoniel True Blues before walking to the police lines. That means they took a conscious decision not to join Ballysillan. Whatever the Order might say, that decision, and the decision by Belfast County Grand Lodge not to have three north Belfast lodges march together this year, resulted in Ballysillan appearing to be isolated, with little support.", "question": "Tuesday marked the first time since a stand - off over a disputed Orange Order parade in Belfast started in July 2013 , that the three lodges involved have not spoken with one @placeholder .", "option_0": "voice", "option_1": "more", "option_2": "parent", "option_3": "level", "option_4": "events", "label": 0}
{"article": "Now, following the leak of the Mossack Fonseca files, the arc lights of publicity are being shone harshly on those, including Britain's prime minister, who appear to have benefited from funds being invested in offshore, low-tax jurisdictions. It may be legal, but the court of public opinion is indignant and moralistic in its judgement. Those Panamanian files are not the start. Corporate tax avoidance - or \"planning\" - has also been put under a much brighter spotlight in recent years. Some of the giants that dominate the digital marketplace have felt the heat from public opinion, including their customers, who don't like what they're learning. It's put some people right off their Starbucks coffee. While tax revenue is scarce, and public services squeezed, the British public understandably want to see the corporate elite, as well as the wealthy, picking up more of the cost of supporting the society from which they benefit. But there's another way of looking at it. Viewed from much of the developing world, Britain is a tax haven. In addition, it does very nicely out of providing financial advice and services to minimise tax bills around the world. Hundreds of billions of pounds-worth of tax revenue that could be going into the public services of developing nations moves into Britain, Ireland, Luxembourg and other relatively low-tax jurisdictions. This has become one of the main campaigning planks for poverty campaign groups such as Christian Aid and Oxfam. It is also enthusiastically pursued by the \"rich country club\" of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). They cite figures from the United Nations conference on trade and development (UNCTAD), published last year. It estimates multi-national corporations pay around $220bn in tax on corporate profits, but use offshore tax loopholes to avoid paying another $100bn. So it's nearly a third gets disappeared. That's in addition to the plunder of assets by individuals, who send their money out of country. The UK is seen as a significant part of that problem. Some economists reckon that a shakedown of the system would not only hit the British Virgin Islands, but Britain itself, as a net loser if there were a transition to a genuinely fair taxation regime around the world. For developing countries, the tax base tends to be weak, in that few individuals have significant income and wealth. Business taxation is therefore more important to them. The UNCTAD study showed that the average developed country relies on corporate taxation for 5% of tax. For developing countries, even without the tax lost to multi-nationals placing their taxable income offshore, the share is double that. In Africa, it is 14%. So when corporate tax is lost, through multi-national companies transferring profit to lower-tax countries, that loads more weight on to the remaining tax payers. It is unfair on smaller companies that do not trade across borders (also true of smaller companies in Britain). And there is a risk that it erodes confidence in the system. The respect for law and HMRC authority in Britain is not shared everywhere. Where taxes are dodged by some, and enforcement is weak, payment of tax quickly comes to be seen as optional. Anti-poverty groups are working together in campaigns to change corporate behaviour on tax - to encourage companies to see tax payment as a responsibility, but also in their own interests. They argue that the good corporate citizen, as with the good individual one, sees tax payment as the price for supporting a stable, law-abiding, prosperous society from which all that income and wealth is derived. It might even be seen as an investment in society. Since the financial crash brought the wheels off last decade's money-making juggernaut, there has been more questioning of whether the legal construct of a company is suited to society's needs. Its mission, defined by statute, legal judgement and convention, is to maximise shareholder value, which can have a destructive effect on societies, workers, justice, human rights and the environment. So there is growing interest in re-defining companies, and directing them to a more nuanced set of priorities.  Using legislation passed in most of the states of the USA over the past six years, the \"Benefit Corporation\" or B-Corp, is one which legally registers as having more on its mind than maximising shareholder value. It has to demonstrate how well it's achieving those other objectives. Italy and Australia are following. Worldwide, 1,600 companies have been certified as B-Corps. Since autumn, a British campaign office has been seeking recruits, with 79 already signed up, ranging across 12 sectors. It may not add much to what's already in place. You might argue that the social enterprise movement in Britain is already well down that road, or that the Community Interest Company, an entity created by a 2005 Westminster law, is ahead of America's B-Corp. It is probably easier to define a company's social or environmental mission from start-up. But converting an existing, conventional company to a Benefit Corporation is a tough sell to boardrooms and to investors. Institutional funds are mostly required to maximise shareholder value as well. And the B-Corp's credit rating is more complex to calculate. This is a big challenge to a factor that runs deep and across societies - the desire first to be financially secure, and then to maximise wealth. The latter is sometimes also known as greed.", "question": "The Panama Papers are offering up much evidence of what was long @placeholder .

Many people are yet to receive the aid, which is piling up at Kathmandu airport, a week after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on 25 April. More than 7,000 have died. Authorities have ruled out finding more survivors. On Saturday, Baroness Amos said she had reminded Prime Minister Sushil Koirala that Nepal had signed an agreement with the UN in 2007 for simpler and faster customs clearance for relief aid in a disaster. \"He has undertaken to ensure that happens, so I hope that from now we will see an improvement in those administrative issues,\" she told AFP news agency. The UN representative in the country, Jamie McGoldrick, said the Nepalese government \"should not be using peacetime customs methodology\". Nepal lifted import taxes on tarpaulins and tents on Friday but home ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal said all goods arriving from abroad had to be inspected. \"This is something we need to do,\" he said. Rameshwor Dangal, of Nepal's National Disaster Management Division, said many people were waiting to receive emergency supplies or be airlifted to safety. \"In many areas people are not getting relief and it is natural that they are unhappy about it,\" he told AFP. At least 7,040 people are now known to have been killed in the quake which struck near Kathmandu, Nepalese officials say. More than 14,021 people were injured. Landslides and poor weather have hampered efforts to deliver aid to isolated districts, and there are only about 20 helicopters available for the rescue and relief operations. In the Sindhupalchok district, which lies north of Kathmandu, north of the capital, 95% of the houses were destroyed, chief district officer Himnath Dawadi told the BBC Nepali. Nepal has criticised both the speed of foreign aid deliveries the type of products countries are sending. Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said: \"We have received things like tuna fish and mayonnaise. What good are those things for us? We need grains, salt and sugar.\" Krishna Devi Sreshta is carefully picking her way through the rubble of what was her home. It's one of about 25 houses in Sankhu, just an hour's drive from Kathmandu, that was completely destroyed by the earthquake. She's here to see if she can salvage anything. \"We were in the field when the earthquake hit,\" she says. \"That's why we were saved.\" Not everyone was so lucky. About 50 members of this community died. She points to the clothes that she's wearing. \"This is what I was wearing last Saturday. It's all I have left.\" Through a narrow doorway I can see the inside of her house, but it's too dangerous to go in. Everything has been removed from the house. \"That was my fridge,\" Krishna says, pointing at some twisted remains outside. \"And over there my television.\" A group of volunteers arrive with shovels and spades and walk past.

{"article": "As the film \"Suffragette,\" opens in British cinemas there is renewed attention on that struggle, one in which Scotland played a vital part. \"For a long time the suffrage movement, as far as history is concerned was located in London and the national leadership was located there too,\" says Dr Norman Watson, a journalist and historian who has researched the suffragettes for 30 years. But he points to the fact that Edinburgh had one of the earliest suffrage societies in the 1870s and by the period after 1905 Scotland was \"punching above its weight\" in the struggle for votes. There were plenty of opportunities to confront the establishment with then prime minister Herbert Asquith having his constituency in Fife and Winston Churchill as an MP for Dundee. He continues: \"So with the militant women pledging to argue at every by-election at which the Liberal party stood because the Liberal party kept refusing them votes, this really catapulted the militancy episode into Scotland and all parts of Scotland were involved.\" When Churchill came to stand in Dundee in 1908 he was followed by 27 of the national leaders of women's suffrage movements. At one point he even hid in a shed and tried to hold a meeting there. There had been lots of campaigning for the vote towards the end of the 19th Century mainly using methods such at petitions, writing letters and badgering members of parliament. That changed in 1903 with the establishment by the Pankhursts, and others, of the Women's Social and Political Union. A branch was opened in Glasgow in 1906 and by 1908 its Scottish headquarters had been opened in the city. \"At first the suffragettes tend to go down to England in order to commit some of the more militant acts,\" says Prof Sarah Pedersen of Robert Gordon University who is writing a book on the Scottish suffragettes. \"We don't really get much militant suffrage activity going on Scotland until a couple of years before the First World War but once they get started they do quite a lot of damage.\" She points to the burning down of buildings, the grandstands at Ayr and Perth racecourses, the pouring of acid in post boxes to destroy the mail or burning the slogan 'votes for women' into the greens of golf courses with acid. \"One of the things to note is that they were very careful not to actually harm or kill anyone with all these fires, the places they set fire to were empty. What they were hoping for was that the landowners and the insurance companies would put pressure on the government to give women the vote,\" she continues. A important point for the movement in Scotland was a big rally in Edinburgh in 1909. It was led by the formidable Flora Drummond, riding on horseback. A key figure in the movement, she had grown up in Arran. Edinburgh had a rather less positive claim to fame too though. It was here that the suffragette Ethel Moorhead became the first in Scotland to be force-fed, a practice which came later north of the border. \"There were two prisons in Scotland that did force feed,\" says Donna Moore of the Glasgow Women's Library. \"One was Edinburgh,\" she continues \"although slightly reluctantly, but the main one was Perth and, in fact, when there was a royal visit to Perth there were signs outside saying welcome to your majesty's torture chamber in Perth prison.\" Ms Moore is fascinated by the stories of suffragettes, stories which she feels deserve to be better known. Earlier in the year a group of women took part in a public art event, called \"March of Women\", from the Glasgow Women's Library to Glasgow Green. The idea was to celebrate women's history and achievements, past and present. The site was chosen as the green had been the venue for many rallies and marches by both suffragettes and suffragists. World War One is often credited with bringing some women the vote in 1918. But Norman Watson says \"in many respects we forget about the valuable work that the constitutionalists did, the non-militant women\". He reckons there were perhaps 100 plus militant suffragettes in Scotland, but thousands who were pursuing similar aims but by different means. \"My view is that by 1914 when the worst of the forcible feeding was happening I think we were heading towards the government giving in, and I actually think the women might have got the vote in 1916, two years before they did.\"", "question": "From throwing an egg at Winston Churchill , to a huge suffrage march in Edinburgh , to the @placeholder of force - feeding , Scotland 's suffragettes and the more gradualist suffragists were an important part of the fight for women 's votes .", "option_0": "core", "option_1": "horrors", "option_2": "start", "option_3": "practice", "option_4": "lure", "label": 1}
{"article": "Data from Education DataLab shows about 20,000 secondary pupils left before they sat their GCSE exams. If the students had remained, some schools would not have scored as highly on the official league tables. Of the 100 schools in England which would have seen the biggest shift, 62 were in London. The figures are from 2,901 state-funded secondary schools in England across four years. Education Datalab, an independent research group, recalibrated the results according to how long each pupil spent in each school. Each pupil should spend 15 terms in secondary education. For example, if a pupil spent six terms in one school, then that school would receive 40% of the results, while the other 60%. Currently, league tables are worked out from how many children were on-roll in January of their final year. Children may leave school because of being managed out, expulsions or moving house. They are also more likely to be from poorer backgrounds or have special educational needs. The figures show Harris Academy Greenwich would have seen the biggest impact on its league table position. One year it would have seen its GCSE pass rates for grades A-C drop by 15%. In the last four years 611 pupils completed their secondary education at the school, while 217 left before the January of their final year. Nine out of the bottom 100 were also Harris Academies. A Harris Federation spokesperson said many of its schools joined the federation because they were failing and had a high proportion of pupils considered to be disadvantaged. \"London - which is where all of our schools are located - has high pupil mobility. It is no surprise that this would be even higher in recently failing schools with very large catchment areas and in areas of disadvantage,\" the spokesperson added. But Philip Nye from Education Datalab said there were some weaknesses in the league table system and that it could be improved by making schools accountable for all children. \"We do think in a minority of cases there might be some head teachers who are using pupil moves to boost their league table moves,\" he added. A Department for Education spokesperson said exclusions could only be issued on disciplinary grounds and that it was introducing stronger measures to ensure mainstream schools continue to be accountable for the progress of pupils they place in alternative provision.

In 2010, 4,337 motorcyclists were injured in London, which by 2014 rose to 5,233, an increase of nearly 21%. The report found the inconsistency over access to bus lanes causes \"unnecessary confusion\" as TfL allows motorcyclists to ride in bus lanes on the roads it manages, while many boroughs do not. It also asked TfL to monitor the impact of dedicated Cycle Superhighways on the road space shared by other traffic. The report also called on authorities to educate young riders. Valerie Shawcross, chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee, said: \"Arguably motorcyclists have been overlooked in public discussion about road safety in recent years. \"However, 36 motorcyclists were killed on London's roads last year, a death toll that is unacceptably high, and part of a bigger picture of collisions and injuries affecting motorcyclists, many of them life-changing in their seriousness.\" TfL said that since September police had stopped 5,389 riders, issued 742 traffic offence reports, 1,335 verbal warnings, seized 96 motorcycles and made 10 arrests.

Madden started this season, then went for surgery after taking charge of Celtic's 4-1 win over Aberdeen in August. He returned to refereeing two months later. \"Only when I was first diagnosed,\" replied Madden after being asked if he thought his career may be over. \"I realised very quickly after the surgery that everything had gone well and that I would go back to refereeing. Whether I thought I would come back as quickly as I did, maybe not so. That was due to the care I was given and the focus and support around me. \"I took the decision in December 2015 to focus totally on my refereeing and I gave up my job because of the demands of domestic and international football. So really I wanted to get back to football to prove that I'd made the right decision and to be successful in refereeing. \"When the consideration was being given to the Scottish Cup final, I'd had a good season so I was hopeful and when the call came in to say I was refereeing it, it was fantastic news and an honour.\" Madden believes this has been his best season as an official, and in March took charge of his first Old Firm derby.

{"article": "\"Varying\" could take taxes down, but we're not hearing much about that happening. Conservatives would like to lower them over the next parliament, but don't want deeper spending cuts to make them appear even more austere than George Osborne. A significant contribution their tax commission has made is to suggest Scotland could have another tier of income tax, between the basic and higher rate, taxing some income at, say, 30%. Depending how it is designed, that is most likely to affect those earning in the thirty and forty thousands zone. If it is not to increase tax on some, it will only apply to a new tranche of earnings over \u00a342,400. Among other parties, the debate is skewed towards using the new powers to raise income tax rates - to \"end austerity\" or \"protect public services\". It is making this election campaign very different from before. Labour is arguing that the Scottish Rate of Income Tax should go up in the 2016-17 financial year. That's this April. The legislation newly in force, for the year ahead, does not give MSPs the ability to have varied increases on different bands. So Labour says Finance Secretary John Swinney should raise tax by 1 pence across all bands, and then hand a \u00a3100 rebate to those earning under \u00a320,000. It's made for some lively exchanges between the two parties. But perhaps they're... well, a bit phoney. Both sides are right, with Labour's claim that its policy would be progressive: higher earners suffer more pain, which isn't quite what the SNP had been arguing. The SNP is right in its counter-claim that the plan would take more tax from those of modest means: earning \u00a320,001, where you get no rebate, still puts you about five grand under the average skilled workers' salary. It's far from clear that Holyrood can pay a tax rebate, either legally or practically. If it can, it may be taxable - an absurd \u00a320 tax on a tax rebate (for which perhaps there should be a rebate). Then expert analysis by week's end showed that the rebate is a poorly targeted support for low earners. Around a tenth of it would go to around 100,000 people living in the 20% of households with the highest total earnings (such as higher earners' spouses with part-time jobs). But perhaps the most phoney element is political. The SNP has a Holyrood majority, and it isn't going to make such a radical amendment to the current Budget Bill - not just before an election, and least of all because Labour says it should. Even if Labour were to return to power after May's election, it would have to wait until next year to implement tax changes. That's when Holyrood is on track to have more flexibility for setting bands with thresholds, setting rates and re-distributing the tax burden. No more need for that rebate. It's clear that the SNP (though the leadership has not explicitly spelled it out yet) will have something along those lines in its manifesto too, to be implemented after the powers come in. So it's likely that the sound and fury of recent days may turn into a broad tax-raising consensus - including Liberal Democrats, but not Tories - by the time their manifestos are published. That sound and fury has drowned out some of the interesting messages from two studies published on Friday by public finance experts - one from the Resolution Foundation, the other by Professor David Bell and David Eiser at the Centre for Constitutional Change. Also worth a read is Gavin Kelly's blog. He is a former Downing Street adviser and Resolution Foundation director who chairs the Living Wage Commission. Here are five observations that struck me: The reverse is also true, so tax-cutters beware: take \u00a31 off the tax bill of those on Universal Credit, and it reduces their benefit entitlement by 67 pence. Plus, that UK welfare reform is itself fiercely complicated, and two benefits systems will probably have to run in parallel for some time. As Gavin Kelly points out, this is about policy coherence. Once Scotland's politicians have got their heads around income tax, its interaction with the benefits system and with national insurance looks likely to be the next battle-front with Westminster.", "question": "Who wins and who loses ?

{"article": "It hopes to unearth the detailed history of what has been described as the \"best preserved\" World War One internment camp in the world. It was home to up to 4,500 German prisoners of war during the conflict. Dr Chris Bowles, Scottish Borders Council's archaeologist, said the project was important as without it the story of the camp could be lost. The site was acquired by the UK government from the owners of the Stobs Castle Estate in 1902 and the following year it was established as the main training base for British soldiers in Scotland, hosting 20,000 soldiers in its first full year. However, usage tailed off during the following decade and its future was in doubt until the outbreak of war in 1914 when it started a new role. Dr Bowles started a project proposal for the area several years ago, having identified the potential of the site. \"This really is a huge project, and will be one of the biggest archaeology projects in Scotland,\" he said. \"Stobs Camp is of international significance because of the excellent state of preservation of some of its infrastructure - it is the best preserved First World War internment camp in the world and was the headquarters of the POW camp system in Scotland. \"This project is important as without it there is a real danger that the story of Stobs will be lost and the buildings that remain deteriorate further.\" He said the aim was to develop a management plan for the site, improve access for visitors and create interpretation materials, including an app, to make sure the important role of the site was remembered. Dr Bowles said: \"Stobs was used to house POWs for over five years, stretching on until after the war was officially over, and during that time around 45 POWs died in the camp from various ailments, despite there being a hospital on site. \"The camp commandant allowed the prisoners to create a cemetery, which still exists, although in the early 1960s the bodies were all exhumed and reburied in a German war graves cemetery in Staffordshire.\" Prisoners built a cairn to remember their comrades at Stobs and also planted a ring of yew trees behind the memorial. However, the memorial was destroyed and the Stobs camp was decommissioned by the army in the 1960s. As part of the new project, the Borders Family History Society is tracing the ancestors of the German soldiers and seamen interred at Stobs. It also aims to restore the cairn and host a special ceremony on Armistice Day 2018, on the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One. Andrew Jepson from Archaeology Scotland, the Stobs Camp project officer, said: \"Stobs Camp has a fascinating story to tell, and so far we have only just scratched the surface. \"We are now very much at the start of what will be an exciting journey of discovery. \"Along with our team of volunteers we will now be able to conduct a detailed survey of the POW camp, record the camp buildings and undertake targeted excavation.\" The project has been supported by SBC, Historic Environment Scotland, the Hawick Archaeological Society, Borders Family History Society, Live Borders and other local partners.

Owner Dietrich Mateschitz has said he will pull the team out of the sport if they do not get it. But Ferrari's position is that at this late stage they do not have the logistical or technical capacity to give 2016 engines to Red Bull in addition to their other two customers, Sauber and the new Haas team. F1 insiders have raised the possibility of Red Bull carrying on with Renault despite everything - their existing deal has not been completely terminated and it runs to the end of 2017. But the two parties have fallen out following the collapse of trust on both sides, and reviving their relationship would be difficult.

He could take home as much as \u00a3499,999, making him the top-earning presenter at BBC Northern Ireland, and the papers give more than a dozen pages between them to discussing the sum. The Daily Mirror runs an \"exclusive\" saying that the north Belfast man has turned down an offer of \u00a31m from a rival commercial broadcaster. The two-year contract would've allowed him to cut his workload by half but would've doubled his money, the paper reports. An unnamed friend of the TV and radio presenter tells the paper why he turned it down, saying: \"His ambition was always to work for the Beeb and for now it still is. \"But he's not daft - the doors to other opportunities are never closed.\" Nolan himself confirms to the News Letter that he has rejected more lucrative offers of work from other companies because the BBC offers a \"very special platform\". \"I don't want to come across as arrogant but the factual position is I have been offered more money for less work,\" he says, adding that he won't elaborate on other approaches \"because it would break confidences\". In its editorial, the paper says many people will be \"outraged\" by the size of his salary but plenty of others \"will think he is worth it\". \"Mr Nolan maddens listeners and viewers as much as he delights them, but the simple fact is that he has transformed that mid-morning Radio Ulster slot and made it one of the most popular shows in the history of the station,\" it says. \"Mr Nolan is such a colourful personality that when he is off his radio show it loses some of its edge.\" Flick through the Belfast Telegraph and you'll find a full five pages, plus two opinion pieces on BBC pay-packets, with much of the focus on Nolan.

It is a \"constant cast-and-mouse game\" with the bonfire builders, who he says are an \"antisocial element within the community\". The worries come after windows in a block of apartments in south Belfast was cracked by the heat of a loyalist bonfire last week.

{"article": "Ansaru was formed in January 2012, though it rose to prominence only about six months later through the release of a video in which it vowed to attack Westerners in defence of Muslims worldwide. \"For the first time, we are glad to announce to the public the formation of this group that has genuine basis,\" said a statement issued by the group in January 2012 and quoted in local media. \"We will have [a] dispassionate look into everything, to encourage what is good and see to its spread and to discourage evil and try to eliminate it.\" Its full Arabic name, Jama'atu Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis Sudan, means: \"Vanguards for the Protection of Muslims in Black Africa\". This suggests that it has a wider regional agenda, with the UK listing Ansaru as a \"terrorist group\" linked to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Just two months after it was formed, the UK said the militant group had killed a Briton and an Italian taken hostage in the north-western state of Sokoto after a failed attempt to rescue them. Then in December 2012, it abducted French national Francis Colump, 63, following an attack on a well-guarded compound in the northern town of Rimi, about 25km (15 miles) from Katsina city. About 30 Ansaru gunmen used dynamite to force their way into the compound, seizing Mr Colump who, officials, said, was working on a wind power project. It carried out a similar attack in February 2013, capturing seven foreign nationals from a housing compound owned by the Lebanese construction company Setraco. It said the attack was to avenge \"transgressions\" by European nations in Mali and Afghanistan, where Western forces are battling Islamist insurgents. On Saturday, it released a video saying it had killed the \"Christian\" hostages because the UK and Nigerian forces were planning an operation to rescue them - an allegation the UK denied. It has also carried out attacks on Nigerian targets. In January 2013, Ansaru said it had carried out an attack which killed two Nigerian soldiers as they prepared to deploy to Mali. The group said it targeted the troops because the Nigerian military was joining the French-led military campaign to \"demolish the Islamic empire of Mali\". French journal Jeune Afrique-L'Intelligent says Ansaru is led by the little-known Abu Ussamata al-Ansary. It quoted a statement by him as saying that the Nigerian government was \"incapable of defending Muslims in inter-religious violence with Christians\". The group also said it was fighting to reclaim \"the lost dignity of Muslims of black Africa\" and the creation of an Islamic caliphate from Niger to Cameroon and northern Nigeria. Analysts believe it is an off-shoot of Boko Haram, which launched an insurgency in 2009 to create an Islamic state in Nigeria, rather than across the region. \"To some, the sect headed by Ansary is seen as one that will compliment the 'struggle' by the Boko Haram sect under Imam Abubakar Shekau but to many it is an indication that all is not well with the leadership of the Boko Haram sect and that there has been conflict about its ideology and its understanding of Islam,\" wrote journalist Tukur Mamu in Nigeria's Desert Herald newspaper last year. \"Hence, the decision to form a new group.\" According to Nigeria's Standard newspaper, Ansaru has denounced Boko Haram's style of operation as \"inhuman to the Muslim ummah [nation]\", an apparent reference to killing of innocent Nigerians - Christian and Muslim - through bombings and assassinations. \"Islam forbids killing of innocent people, including non-Muslims. This is our belief and we stand for it,\" Mr al-Ansary said in the video released last year. But Mr al-Ansary added that non-Muslims can be killed \"in self-defence or if they attack Muslims\", which seems to explain the killing of Nigerian soldiers to be deployed to Mali. However, analysts say it does not justify the killing of civilian hostages - unless Ansaru holds them accountable for the actions of Western governments in countries such as Mali, Iraq and Afghanistan. Analysts believe that Nigeria's government will find it more difficult to end the Islamist insurgency now that two groups are operating. The government is said to be working with counter-terrorism experts from several countries - including the US and UK - in an attempt to neutralise the threat posed by Boko Haram and Ansaru, amid fears that they could worsen instability across West and central Africa.", "question": "Nigeria 's militant Islamist group Ansaru has proved to be a formidable threat during its short existence , using dynamite to @placeholder heavily - fortified compounds and taking foreigners hostage - seven of whom it said it had killed on Saturday .", "option_0": "penetrate", "option_1": "employ", "option_2": "deliver", "option_3": "join", "option_4": "deter", "label": 0}
{"article": "Dear Donor family, In 1990, when I was just 23, I developed renal failure and started peritoneal dialysis. I was a nurse in a busy Glasgow hospital, which I loved. Then I started dialysis. I would dialyse four times a day. I was so tired and was sick a few times a day, not eating and my weight dropped to six stones. My blood count was six instead of 12. I was unable to go out with friends as I couldn't stand for more than 20 minutes without needing to sit down. I continued to work and then just go home and rest. My social life was non-existent and at one point I couldn't see this getting any better. However, three years later, I was just about to start my shift at work when the sister came running up to me and told me not to get changed. There had been a phone call, I had a transplant match. My lovely colleague Michelle took me to the hospital. I had surgery about four hours later and was walking about within 48 hours. I Six days later I was home, feeling hungry and full of energy. This has changed my life enormously, I am so grateful for the decision made by you. You were able to make a decision to donate your child's organs while going through such a traumatic time yourself. I will always remember you and have often been in awe of your decision. I am 49, married, a mum to a lively 9-year-old and I'm still a nurse. None of this would have been possible without your amazing gift of life. My transplant birthday is 31 August which we celebrate every year - 23 this year! Pauline Dear Type 1 Diabetes, You arrived completely out of nowhere. A horrible monster that has taken up residence with my son. You're aggressive and harmful and you won't go away. You follow my son everywhere. You're there when he eats, you're there when he plays, when he goes to school, and even while he sleeps. I can't control you monster, I can only adapt everything in my life to cater for you and \"manage\" your existence. Why couldn't you have chosen me instead of my sweet innocent child? I wish I could take you from my son but I can't. Instead, I watch your every move. I anticipate your next attack, and prepare to manage your fury. We feed you insulin several times a day. Sometimes that's enough but sometimes there's no telling what you will do next. There are no rules. You keep quiet for a while and just as I think I have got some kind of control you will strike! We got a machine that makes the balance between life and monster less painful but it's still there, forever waiting. I pray that you will leave and never come back. The new machine allows me days where I can almost forget that you're here, and then other days where I catch myself looking at my beautiful boy carrying this heavy monster on his back and it makes me weep. I almost mourn the past. The freedom and innocence that have gone will never return. I check my son regularly to see what damage has been caused by the monster who chose to live with us. Daily we prepare for battle. Daily we pray for an antidote that will kill the monster and free my son of its burden. For now, my son is strong and wise but I fear the day he leaves our home to live on his own with the monster. A parent wants to protect their child, but I have to watch as my son battles 24-hours-a-day. This is his life. I can only stand on the sidelines and offer my support and my love. I wish I could offer a cure and rid my baby of this horrible monster. I wish it had chosen me. Angie Dear Father, This letter is a small way to say \"thank you\" for changing my identity forever. When you travelled as a young man from Bangladesh to the UK in the 1960s, leaving your family behind to make a better life for yourself, little did you know the effect it would have on me. When you arrived with a single suitcase, a five pound note and a London address scribbled on a piece of paper, you were taking a big risk. You got a teaching job and integrated as much as possible, notwithstanding the racism of 60s London. You went back to Bangladesh, only to marry my mother, and returned to the UK where my brother and I were born. You wanted us to be British and give us opportunities you never had. You made sure we went to British Universities and have a solid British identity. Although I have a Bengali heritage, which I am very proud of, it is hard for me to claim that I am (with any true meaning) a Bengali. Whilst you took me to Bangladesh several times growing up, it was only for the summer holidays; we never lived there and (in the nicest way) I was treated like a foreigner by my family there. I cannot claim that being Bengali is a major part of my identity, maybe around 10%. The other 90%, I feel British. Give me the \"cricket test\" any day, I'd always choose England. Even though our identities may clash sometimes, your move changed who I am today. So thank you. Your forever grateful younger son. Riad Dear Accident, It was a sunny morning in Cambridge when you changed me.  Crushed but still whole, injured but not dead, damaged but not broken. You challenged me to push my body and mind to their absolute limits as I learnt to walk again three times, when I had to escape the depths of post traumatic stress and when I had to learn to live in the world again. But out of all the pain and adversity, you taught me strength and perseverance. I took the negative and made it positive. I saw how much love was around me that I should never take for granted. You propelled me to push my limits, take risks and never say no. I explored the world, made friends for life and spread my wings like never before. Accident, as much as you hurt me and those closest to me, I have to say thank you. You have made me the strong, independent person I am today. So yes, you changed me, but I am a better person for it. Yours sincerely Sheena Dear Salsa, You changed me. I arrived in London almost six years ago, a young shy Italian woman, with some confidence in her brains and not much confidence in her social or physical skills. Before I met you I didn't really like it here. I found it difficult to meet people and make friends, the city seemed cold and indifferent. I felt, once more, like the odd one out, and wasn't too positive about my future. But then you came along, and amazingly enough you brought with you many smart, funny, sociable and caring people! While dancing I found out it was so easy to start a conversation, make a joke, share a smile. Through your happy, strong beat you showed me how to let go of all my daily worries and stress and just follow the music, follow my lead, follow my body, for hours and hours, five days a week. You opened up doors to me that I didn't even know existed. Now we don't see each other anymore, but that doesn't mean I forgot about you and what you did for me. You will always be my first English (Cuban) love. Marta Dear Epilepsy, When you first arrived I was twelve years old. From a social butterfly to a bedbound haze in a flash. The rules changed and strange new ones became habit: Never bathe alone, walk on the inside of the street, carry limited cash, don't lock the bathroom door and don't go anywhere by yourself. I was told that I wouldn't be able to work or drive. No dignity, no answers, no certainties. A boyfriend? A family? We will see. Children? Maybe. You may overwhelm me frequently but you will not overwhelm my life. I follow the rules you impose in order to be safe. You turned my world upside down but part of me remained. I'm not a teacher as I wished but I have a job and a husband. Soon I hope to have a family. I must be realistic - some dreams aren't meant to be but we'll see. My dreams and aspirations are those which \"normal\" people just have. They aren't wild or imaginative but you've made sure I appreciate the normality I was told I'd never have. You've shaped and enhanced me. Now I'm a fighter - wiser, sympathetic and stronger. I don't despise you as I once did, the hatred has been channelled into a will to defeat you. I now spend my days defeating you rather than being defeated by you. I'll see you again soon. Or maybe not.

{"article": "Newspapers said RAF Tornados in Iraq had been fitted with heat-seeking missiles designed for aerial combat. But the Ministry of Defence said there was \"absolutely no truth\" in this. The Foreign Office said concern about Russian military action in Syria had been reiterated by the attache. Prime Minister David Cameron has previously said Russian military intervention in Syria is helping only to support \"the butcher\", President Bashar al-Assad. He has also expressed concerns that Russian forces are not discriminating between air strikes on Islamic State (IS) militants and others fighting the Syrian president. The RAF has been carrying out air strikes against IS militants in Iraq since the action was approved by MPs in 2014, but UK military intervention in Syria has not been backed in Parliament. By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondent, BBC News This curious footnote to the air campaign being waged over Iraq and Syria illustrates the potential for misunderstanding now that Russia is conducting major independent operations of its own. RAF Tornados based in Cyprus are carrying out air strikes only in Iraq, though potentially could be flying over Syria on intelligence gathering missions as well. Either way, en route to or from Iraq, they could come into close proximity with Russian warplanes. However, the Ministry of Defence in London has denied any suggestion that they are being armed with air-to-air missiles so as to defend themselves in any encounter. The Russian government called in the British air attache in Moscow after reading erroneous reports in the British press suggesting air-to-air missiles were being fitted. What is Russia's endgame in Syria? The battle for Iraq and Syria in maps A Foreign Office spokesman said the defence attache met Russian ministry of defence officials on Sunday. \"The Russian government sought clarification over inaccurate newspaper reports concerning RAF rules of engagement in Iraq,\" the Foreign Office spokesman said. \"The defence attache reiterated the British government's concerns about Russia's military operation in Syria, including targeting legitimate opposition groups, using unguided weaponry and leading to large numbers of civilian deaths.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin has defended the military operations in Syria, saying the aim is to \"stabilise the legitimate authority\" of Mr al-Assad. He denied that Russian air strikes were hitting moderate opposition groups rather than IS militants. Mr Putin told Russian state TV that Moscow also wanted to \"create conditions for a political compromise\" in Syria. In 2013, British MPs voted against action in Syria, amid claims - denied by President Assad - that he was using chemical weapons against his own people. Now the government wants to extend its bombing campaign against IS militants from Iraq into Syria, but says it will only do so with Parliamentary approval.

{"article": "Matthew Eteson denies the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster and her daughter Lauren Thornton. The pair died on a boat on Windermere in April 2013. Preston Crown Court heard Mr Eteson had fabricated the exhaust system of an onboard petrol-driven generator. A statement from the 42-year-old, of Hale, Greater Manchester, was read out in court describing how the generator was used to power the boat's mains appliances. The court was told he had taken the generator off the boat to make moderations by fitting it with a silencer because it was noisy for neighbours. The system was fitted the day before the deaths of Ms Webster, 36, and her 10-year-old daughter, of Leyland, Lancashire. During his voluntary interview in April 2013 Mr Eteson said he had been aware of the dangers of fumes. He added that he had sought advice from friends and said the construction \"wasn't something I took lightly\". The family had been at a 50th birthday on the evening of 31 March 2013 before returning to the boat. The following morning Mr Eteson said he had felt sick and went to buy lunch before returning.

The jury was told the generator was running as they ate their lunch and he then fell asleep at the table below deck. The court heard when he woke he could not move and initially believed he was having problems with his heart. In police statement, he said: \"I just knew there was something not right with me.

{"article": "There have been cheers and jubilation in the US and elsewhere in the West, but capital cities around the world are already bracing for the repercussions of Bin Laden's killing. Hundreds of dedicated and would-be jihadis will be mourning and swearing to give their lives in revenge for his death at the hands of US special forces in the city of Abbottabad. There is little doubt that the death of Bin Laden is a huge blow to al-Qaeda. But at the same time the network has moved over the years from a highly centralised hierarchy - with recruiting, training and orders all scrutinised by its top leaders - to something much more loose and amorphous. Today al-Qaeda's philosophy is one man, one bomb. It does not need another 9/11 to make its mark. One bomb in Times Square in New York placed by a dedicated suicide bomber or a bomb in a New York subway - both attacks were attempted in in recent years -  are big enough indicators that al-Qaeda is alive and kicking. Al-Qaeda has been a franchise for many years. Anyone can join it by planting a bomb somewhere. Almost anyone can come to Pakistan or Afghanistan and be offered training with key al-Qaeda allies such as the Pakistani Taliban or the Afghan group headed by Jalaluddin Haqqani. The facilitator in Pakistan's cities has been Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) - a banned militant group which previously fought in Kashmir but now attacks many different targets and helps al-Qaeda. After 9/11 it helped hide many senior al-Qaeda figures and it may well have played a major role in hiding Bin Laden. Pakistan has refused to go up against al-Qaeda allies like Haqqani because they were operating in Afghanistan not Pakistan. Likewise, allies like LeT are close to Pakistan's intelligence services because their main target is Kashmir and India. Thus the threat is there. Before 9/11 there were no known al-Qaeda cells in Europe except for the one in Hamburg which launched those attacks. However, today every single European country has an al-Qaeda cell. Hundreds of Muslims with European passports have travelled to Pakistan's tribal areas for training and returned to Europe. After the arrest of three Moroccans in Germany last week for planning to plant bombs in public places, German authorities admit that over 200 German citizens have had training in the tribal areas and many of them have returned to Germany. The same is the case in Britain, Scandinavia, France, Spain and Italy. The fear now of random suicide bombings in subway or train stations in the US or Europe is particularly high. So is the threat of plane hijackings and bombings of Western military targets and embassies in the Middle East, where they are already a frequent target. There is also the possibility of the amateur jihadi placing a bomb in a supermarket. Other kinds of attacks are also likely. Some may be carried out by dedicated long-term jihadis who have been placed amid Western societies and who now may spring into action with a plot and target that they have been working on for years. Such lone attackers have been found in the US before, with individuals travelling to the tribal areas for training and then returning to a major US city and trying to carry out an attack. These have usually been foiled by law enforcement agencies at the last moment. Afghanistan, Pakistan and India are also particularly at risk from more organised attacks. In the former, the al-Qaeda influence among dedicated jihadis like the Haqqani group is still strong. Pakistan is also extremely vulnerable to attack. Despite a constant spate of denials from the Pakistani authorities - which have now been proven wrong - al-Qaeda recently had its base in Pakistan. Al-Qaeda and its affiliated Pakistani groups will be determined to launch a bombing campaign in Pakistan in memory of Bin Laden. This will heighten tensions in a country that is already beset with power shortages and an economic crisis. Finally al-Qaeda and its allies may find this the right moment to create major divisions between India and Pakistan by launching another Mumbai-style attack on Indian territory. This would aim to take the heat off the hunt for al-Qaeda members in Pakistan. The Middle East also remains a big vacuum for al-Qaeda because of the ongoing Arab revolt. It is still a prime target for al-Qaeda as it seeks to gain influence and clout among the new generation of leaders who have emerged in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and the Gulf states. But this task will be much more difficult after Bin Laden's death. Clearly Bin Laden's death will give intelligence agencies around the world many clues and leads to catch other leaders, but al-Qaeda will not disappear overnight.

{"article": "Whatever your perspective or personal views of what Mr Aamer is, was, or represents, his return to the UK was greeted with a collective sigh of relief across Whitehall. The 5,017 days of detention were not only a real point of tension in the critical transatlantic relationship; they also soured and compromised attempts by the government to reach out to some of the hardest-to-reach Muslim communities. In the short term, he will begin to receive expert medical help, including a psychiatric assessment. He will finally get to meet the son who was born on the day he arrived at Guantanamo Bay. But for some, Mr Aamer's return represents a risk. Davis Lewin, of the Henry Jackson Society, a security and foreign relations think tank, has urged the UK to think very carefully about how it manages and monitors him now he is back. Mr Aamer's legal team have said he will submit to whatever monitoring is required - although they also argue it is unnecessary because the case against him comes from unreliable allegations extracted during torture. If MI5 decides to monitor him, he may never know for sure that it is happening - such is the nature of that kind of work. There are bigger questions for the UK, questions of legacy and lessons to be learnt. Critics argue that in the wake of 9/11 the US was not the only country to lose its legal map and moral compass. London didn't seem to want to tell Washington that Guantanamo was a bad idea - and it didn't insist that any British men detained in Afghanistan be brought back to the UK. That, say critics, was a dereliction of long-standing British principles of justice. \"Human rights and justice and the rule of law are for everybody,\" says former Conservative cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, a member of the cross-party group that lobbied Washington to release Mr Aamer. \"He has been denied that. Not only is that terrible for him, but we have to be better than that if we're going to defeat the scourge of terror and terrorism. \"We're going to have to rise above these things and stick to the rule of law, and accept that human rights belong to everyone.\" Some American interrogations involved intelligence material provided by Britain - and that could amount to complicity in torture. And so, many MPs are now pushing for real answers to questions about Britain's role in the weeks and months after 9/11. \"One of the things that it is absolutely essential that happens in due course is that [Shaker Aamer] looks the camera in the eye in Britain and says what happened to him,\" says Mr Mitchell. \"If as is alleged he was tortured, and if there was any UK involvement in that, we need to get to the bottom of that not only because it's utterly wrong if it was done in our name, but also because we need to ensure that these sort of circumstances don't happen to anyone else.\" But why haven't those answers come out yet? The government fought a mammoth legal battle to prevent courts disclosing the full extent of what ministers and officials knew about the transfer of men to Guantanamo. But the claimants ultimately accepted a multi-million pound settlement - meaning the government never had to disclose what happened. Parliament then passed the Justice and Security Act which allows ministers to apply to hear cases in secret - closing that door for good. Campaigners still hoped the facts would emerge in a full judge-led inquiry into complicity in rendition. The promised inquiry was shelved because there is still the possibility of criminal charges in relation to alleged rendition to Libya. So it is now down to the Intelligence and Security Committee to investigate. Earlier this week, the committee's new chair, Dominic Grieve QC, said he wanted to get started. The last detainee with a UK connection now has a long and complicated road ahead of him. He has to learn how to stop being Detainee 239 of Guantanamo Bay and become Shaker Aamer, father of four, of south-west London.

The Israeli military used its Iron Dome defence system to intercept and destroy the missile. A fifth battery had been added to it, just outside the city, only hours earlier. After the explosion, close to the coast, a small black cloud was left hanging in the sky over the sea. Tel Aviv is Israel's largest city and commercial centre but it is also a popular place to relax or party. However, despite the sunshine, outdoor restaurants, parks and pavements were much quieter over the weekend. It has taken a psychological adjustment for locals to realise that they too are now within the firing range of certain Palestinian rockets - believed to be the Iranian-made Fajr-5, which can reach up to 75km (45 miles). \"For Tel Aviv people this is a bit of a shock. The rockets hit all the time in the north and south of Israel but in Tel Aviv this never happens. I've lived here for ten years,\" said a jogger, Tzipi. Soli, who was carrying his little daughter, remarked: \"Everyone is talking about it. You can see the streets are emptier than usual and this is from just a few missiles.\" But he said there was broad support for the continuing military offensive in the Gaza Strip. \"I'm not happy with the situation where we are bombing Gaza but I think we have to do it, we have to defend ourselves,\" he said. A retired man, Amos, agreed that Palestinian militants posed a real threat. \"We have to finish this problem. This is the language they understand, not the language of peace,\" he said. Asked about the government decision to authorise the call-up of up to 75,000 military reservists, he gave his strong approval. \"We have the force. We need to have it,\" he said. \"I'm sorry about it but this is our life, our destiny.\" With Israeli troops continuing to head towards the Gaza border and speculation about a possible ground invasion, this is a difficult time for families with members serving in the military. \"I'm very worried because my son is doing his national service. He will go south,\" one man said as his wife's eyes filled with tears. \"This is what happens, I cry every time I think of my son,\" she added. The Israeli military, which has its vast headquarters in Tel Aviv, told the BBC that its offensive was putting Hamas, which governs Gaza, \"under great pressure\". However, spokeswoman Avital Leibovich confirmed that incursions still remained a possibility. \"We are getting ready for an option of ground operation.

{"article": "The Spanish-speaking film, starring Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal, is set in Chile in 1988, when a public referendum was called on Pinochet's 15-year coup-seized leadership. The people were to be asked to vote Yes for a continuation of Pinochet's rule or No for him to go. While the Yes campaigners go down a hackneyed route of vaunting Pinochet's great leadership and trashing the opposition, the No camp realise a radical new approach is needed. The people are scared and sceptical of a corrupt process and will take some persuading to even go to the polls. The answer is to hire advertising hotshot Rene Saavedra, who says they must harness the strategies of product advertising, namely the power of the positive message. \"Many people know how Pinochet got into power by overthrowing President Allende but very few know how he got out,\" says Bernal who plays Saavedra. \"Even I, who am from Latin America, didn't know about the campaign that went on. I didn't know how important publicity was to the movement and what actually went on. \"It was one of the most interesting things about the film and encouraged me to do it.\" Used to working on promotions for products such as fizzy drinks, Saavedra dismisses focusing on the atrocities of Pinochet's rule to take the sweet shop approach to the Nos' campaign: shiny imagery of rainbows and a beautiful future full of sun-soaked days of family fun. \"The film sees the birth of democracy in Chile through the eyes of a publicist,\" says Bernal. \"An archetypal publicist doesn't exist, but this character is fascinating because of his joyful attitude. \"He has a childish fascination with toys and things like his new microwave. These kind of things gave the character an interesting way to see the story.\" The No camp, a group made up of 16 political parties, are unsurprisingly unconvinced. But they pull together behind Saavedra in a spirit of unity and camaraderie. It's a dynamic that followed through into the cast, many of whom are the real-life members of the No campaign. \"There was the fraternal aspect to making the movie, which got me closer to the drama and to the freedom that that moment in history experienced,\" says Bernal. As for the members of the Yes campaign, they made a point of making themselves elusive. \"All the protagonists from the campaign were very up for making the movie. Some acted as themselves and others play their antagonists,\" says Bernal. \"They couldn't find people from the Yes campaign. There was only one person who was known but he didn't want to talk. A victory has many generals but a defeat has none.\" One of the original No team is Eugenio Garcia, on whom Bernal's character is based. Garcia, a smiling and gentle man, says he was taken aback when approached by Chilean director Pablo Larrain. \"It was a surprise for me as this happened 25 years ago and then I forgot, did my job and got on with my life,\" says Garcia. \"Now when I see the movie, it's very emotional.  It's a very good interpretation of how we all felt at the time, our fears and anticipation. It makes me remember all the emotions. It's beautiful.\" Meeting Garcia was a true honour and also valuable to understanding and playing Saavedra, say Bernal. It all adds to the film's air of authenticity, which Larrain has taken pains to achieve through the use of an old U-matic camera to help blend news footage from the era with the acting scenes. At heart, Saavedra is just a simple man of the people, deeply concerned for the young son who lives with him and longing to be reconciled with his estranged wife. When the Yes campaign hit back with underhand tactics, Saavedra feels the threats on a deeply personal level, rather than as part and parcel of the dirty game of politics. It sums up the other feeling pervading No: intimacy. This, Bernal explains, is down to Larrain.  No is the final part in Larrain's trilogy covering the Pinochet era. The first two films were Tony Manero and Post Mortem. No signals a closure for the director, who was a child at the time of the events of the film and whose parents were Yes voters. \"It's a film that is very personal to Pablo. He was 12 when this happened,\" says Bernal. \"It is, for him and other Chileans, a reconciliation, not just with society or the country, but with one's own history.\" Ultimately, the No campaign is triumphant. An unexpected 97% of registered voters turn out at the polls. The No campaign wins almost 56% of the vote. Pinochet stepped down in 1990 after losing democratic presidential and parliamentary elections. When he died in 2006, he was still to stand trial for human rights abuses, as ordered by the Chilean courts. This \"injustice\" is just one of the many issues that make No relevant to today's audience, says the politically-minded Bernal. But would he ever turn his interest into a career? \"I am very interested in politics,\" says the actor, who is a big supporter of human rights group Amnesty International. \"But as for going into it seriously in a formal way, I can't see that happening. Then again how many politicians have said the same?\" No is released in the UK on Friday, 8 February.

{"article": "Detentions are a fixture of school life, but do they really improve behaviour? Here are some of your stories. Misbehaviour masterclass \"We used to rip up work and make it 'snow' out the window, ignore teachers and keep chatting, put tacks on their seats, use it as choir practice, paint our nails, cornrow hair,\" says one former London comprehensive pupil, now a junior doctor. Some pupils collect detentions like trophies. \"We were the outlaws, the desperadoes, members of a bad-but-fun gang, playing cat and mouse with authority,\" says a former private school pupil. Another, remembering detentions in the 1980s, says: \"Collapsing of tables was a favourite for us. \"We had real ink pots and trestle tables, so all you had to do was kick the support on the table and the whole thing would collapse and then ink all over the floor. \"'Oops, sorry, don't know how that happened.'\" A former Hertfordshire comprehensive pupil, now in her 20s, says: \"We had so many, it turned into our after school club. \"One of the teachers gave up in the end. And the next time we were in, she put a film on. \"I think it was Romeo and Juliet, the Leonardo [DiCaprio] one. \"If we weren't in trouble, we would wait outside for the ones that were. \"One time I spent 100 minutes in a cupboard in the classroom with a friend. \"We weren't meant to be there, but it was cold outside and it seemed like a fun thing to do whilst we were waiting. \"They weren't a deterrent at all.\" What do you think? Join the conversation - find us on Facebook Forgetting to turn up Many teachers say detentions should take place on the day of the offence, when pupils will understand better why they are being punished. Same-day sanctions also improve pupils' chances of remembering the detention at all. In some schools, even if the original offence is small, such as wearing the wrong shoes, not turning up to detention can result in as much punishment as for someone who started a fight. \"Not a fair system,\" says one recent school leaver from Hillingdon. Confused parents Schools in England do not need permission from parents to impose detentions, and in most cases they are not even required to inform them. So the first they know is when their child is late home, and even then they might not find out why. \"Every other Monday over almost my entire 13th year, I told our parents I was at chess club, which worked well until they found out from talking to the parents of a fellow detainee who let the cat out of the bag,\" says one former London pupil. Another says: \"My mum was too busy to even know I had it half the time. \"So I didn't get into trouble at home.\" All for one Whole-class detentions are particularly controversial with better behaved class members. \"So all 30 of us had to stay behind for a couple of obnoxious people. This is so unfair. How does this help anyone?\" asks one school-leaver. \"Surely, in an ideal world teachers should ask the class for their opinions on the problem and work with them to find a fair and creative solution. How hard can it be?\" Socially useful Some schools make pupils on detention engage in socially useful activities such as litter picking the playground, which can be quite satisfying. And detention can be a chance to get all your homework done in one go, rather than having it last all week. But this approach can backfire too. \"One of the chores we were given to do sometimes in detention was to clean board-rubbers, which was basically a licence to get everything and everyone in sight covered in chalk dust,\" says a former pupil from Cheshire. Detention for teachers With lesson planning, marking and a dozen more extracurricular jobs at the end of the day, supervising an after-school detention is not fun for teachers. \"Deeply dull,\" says one. At some schools, pupils in detention must write an essay on \"what action they did wrong and what choices they have in the future when in that position\". This approach can \"often work\", say some teachers, but others disagree \"I loathed the idea of making children write for a punishment and taking away their valuable time when they could be running around in the sun or staring at ants in the grass,\" says one recent retiree, who never gave a detention in 36 years of teaching. Even supporters of detention say it is futile without proper communication between pupil and teacher. \"It shouldn't be about getting the kid to say sorry,\" says one London teacher. Basic conflict resolution techniques can help, she adds, \"where both sides get to reflect on the situation from the other's point of view\". Pupils need to think about how their behaviour can make teaching very difficult, while teachers could consider whether, in their drive to deliver the curriculum, they might be overlooking pupils' underlying learning difficulties, she says But others fear that in today's results-focused classrooms, \"teachers too often lack the time and the skills\" for this kind of approach.", "question": "It is late November , the summer holidays are ancient history , September resolutions about behaviour and homework are forgotten , everyone is tired , behaviour has @placeholder and detentions are hitting an end - of - term peak .", "option_0": "worsened", "option_1": "accomplished", "option_2": "blocks", "option_3": "slumped", "option_4": "revealed", "label": 3}

The latest data for schools in England shows spending on supply teachers accounted for 6% of the total amount spent on teaching staff wages.  The overall figure spent on supply teachers fell by \u00a318m on the previous year. Schools in London collectively spent the most on supply teachers. Primary and secondary schools in the capital spent \u00a3212m on extra staff, the equivalent of \u00a3260 per child. The Robert Clack School, in Dagenham, east London, spent the most on supply teachers in England. According to the government's data the school spent \u00a3953,807 on extra staff - the equivalent of \u00a3526 per child. Dr Neil Geach, the school's chair of governors, said the figures included expenditure on counselling staff, extra-curricular sport staff and professional development spending. \"The figures as reported do not reflect reality... We do not use unqualified staff or cover supervisors to cover teaching groups - our children's education is too important.\" Aside from London, Yorkshire and Humberside had the highest spending rate for supply staff of \u00a3161 per pupil, followed by schools in the West Midlands, which spent \u00a3160. Schools in the East of England spent the lowest amount per pupil - \u00a3137 for every child. Graham School in Scarborough, North Yorkshire spent \u00a3556,776 on supply teachers during the course of 2014-15, which was the highest amount in Yorkshire and Humberside. Two years ago, the school was in special measures owing to its poor performance and as a result the new head teacher Helen McEvoy said she had to replace 45% of the teachers who were working in the school. \"Yes we have spent on a lot on extra teachers but that reflects the successful journey we've been on coming out of special measures,\" she said. \"Our use of supply teachers reflects how in the past we've had a lot of vacant posts and that's because it can be hard to attract teachers to come and work in a remote part of the country.\" Government figures for 2014 show that teacher vacancy rate across England stood at 0.3%, which meant about 1,000 posts were vacant. Teachers unions have expressed concerns about the use of private supply teacher agencies, claiming that some firms are putting the pursuit of profit ahead of providing high quality teachers. The BBC found schools spent twice as much on buying in extra staff through private agencies than sourcing additional staff through local councils.

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: \"Supply teachers provide a valuable role for schools, and schools themselves are best placed to make staffing decisions to reflect their individual needs. It is up to head teachers and governors to decide who is required for the job and this includes how best to cover absences. \"The number and quality of teachers is at a record high, with over 1,000 more graduates training to teach secondary subjects now than a year ago.

The main suspect in her disappearance, Robert Howard, died in prison last year. Kathleen Arkinson said she she felt police had missed opportunities to question some witnesses. She complained to the Police Ombudsman in 2006 about the police investigation, the inquest heard. She said police searched her house, breaking her door down with a sledgehammer, dug in her garden, and arrested her partner, adding \"insult to injury already caused by the lack of investigation\". Ms Arkinson also felt Howard's trial in 2005 for Arlene's murder was mishandled because the jury was unaware of his many convictions. She added that after Arlene went missing, false rumours grew worse. \"The rumours were that I killed Arlene,\" she said. \"The whole world was talking about it.\" Later, Ms Arkinson was questioned by counsel for the Police Service of Northern Ireland, who asked if it was the service's \"duty to investigate every opportunity to find out what happened\". \"It should have been,\" she replied, \"but they didn't do it.\" Ms Arkinson also said she became more protective of Arlene after an incident when Arlene was abused by a man in 1993. The man was jailed for that assault. Their mother had died three years earlier. Ms Arkinson told the inquest of the last time she saw Arlene when she left for a disco in Bundoran, and how she had given her an money to buy chips on the way home. She never saw her sister again. She described confronting Howard and a family, the Quinns, who she believed had taken Arlene to Bundoran, and that she had become convinced they were telling lies over her disappearance. Earlier, the mother of one of Arlene's friends told the inquest she became scared of Robert Howard after he told her he had killed a six-year-old girl. Bernadette Timoney, giving evidence via videolink, said in the years before Arlene went missing she thought Howard was \"an evil-looking man with drink in him\". \"I didn't like the look of him,\" she later said. \"I didn't want to be in his company - he was very scary.\" She added that she had daughters of her own and wanted to protect them.

{"article": "They come to the Detroit Motor Show in droves, eager to get a peek at the latest offerings from the big three US car makers and the European manufacturers who are competing for market share in the lucrative car market. But car firms here, while continuing to focus on horsepower, are beginning to turn their attention to processing power. That's because most analysts agree that if car makers want to appeal to a younger generation, who are driving approximately 23% less than they used to, they'll need to shrink cars into, well, iPhones. \"If you look at the buying decisions of the younger generation, they're a little worried about the navigation system that gets you from point A to point B, but mainly they're interested in texting and being able to communicate with their friends,\" says Gary Silberg, the national automotive sector leader at consultancy KPMG. \"Whoever gets that right, that's who will win in the marketplace.\" Dieter Zetsche, the boss of Mercedes, put it more bluntly. \"The car of the future [is] a smartphone on wheels,\" he told the BBC. While only about 10% of cars are connected to the internet today, that number is expected to balloon to 90% by 2020, according to the consulting group Machina Research. The big question is who will be behind the software that connects cars - traditional car manufacturers like Mercedes and General Motors, or Silicon Valley giants like Apple and Google, who have turned their attention towards Detroit? Both tech firms have come out with in-car entertainment operating systems in the last year. \"There is a huge battle between the tech giants and auto firms right now,\" says Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT's) AgeLab and the associate director of the New England University Transportation Center. \"The question is: are you going to go to the dealer five years from now and have the choice of an Apple interface, an Android interface or a [traditional] manufacturer's interface?\" Special Report: Global Car Industry For now, most of the car firms, whose offerings are on display in Detroit, are playing it safe by keeping their options open - while keeping their ears to the ground about what's happening in Silicon Valley. Take Ford, for example. Mark Fields, the company's chief executive, told the BBC that the company was planning to open a Palo Alto office next week, to ensure that it remained close to Silicon Valley while considering its options. \"I think there are a lot of interested parties in what they call the fourth screen now - the screen within the vehicle,\" says Mr Fields. \"There are a lot of competitors that we recognised, a lot of competitors we didn't recognise, and there are probably a bunch of competitors that haven't been born yet that want a piece of the auto industry.\" Ford's strategy has been to continue to develop its software in house, while making sure that it is compatible with the latest tech offerings from elsewhere. It unveiled the latest version of its in-car entertainment software, Sync 3, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) last week, which featured upgrades like the ability to update the software wirelessly, as well as enabling it to interact with apps such as Spotify and AccuWeather. Notably, the company also switched from using Microsoft software to Blackberry's QNX operating system. Yet Don Butler, Ford's executive director of connected vehicle and services, said the company was still committed to remaining \"device agnostic\". \"Whether you've got a Blackberry, iPhone, or any of the various flavours of Android device, your phone will be compatible with the Sync system,\" says Mr Butler. The crucial challenge for everyone will be to keep up with changing technology. \"We're willing to toss out a smartphone every year or so but vehicles need to last 10 years,\" says MIT's Mr Reimer. \"No-one is going to have their iPhone 6 in their hands 20 years from now.\" This need to predict what consumers will want in five, 10 or 20 years is complicated by the fact the industry suffers from a data problem.

And then of course there is the possibility that all of this might be made semi-irrelevant by the introduction of driverless car technology, which would free up our hands altogether. \"We're just at the beginning of a remarkable era where the car is going to change dramatically,\" says Guggenheim Partners senior managing partner John Casesa. \"And all of us are at the moment just trying to figure out how long it will take us to get there.\"", "question": "Detroit in January is largely @placeholder with just one group of people , petrolheads .", "option_0": "tasked", "option_1": "consumed", "option_2": "credited", "option_3": "decorated", "option_4": "filled", "label": 4}
{"article": "Researchers in London who have been carrying out preliminary tests of the fatty acid treatment, report their findings in Neuropharmacology journal. They came up with the idea because of a special diet used by some children with severe, drug resistant epilepsy to help manage their condition. The ketogenic diet is high in fat and low in carbohydrate. The high fat, low carbohydrate diet is thought to mimic aspects of starvation by forcing the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates. Although often effective, the diet has attracted criticism, as side-effects can be significant and potentially lead to constipation, hypoglycaemia, retarded growth and bone fractures. By pinpointing fatty acids in the ketogenic diet that are effective in controlling epilepsy, researchers hope they can develop a pill for children and adults that could provide similar epilepsy control without the side-effects. In early trials, the scientists, from Royal Holloway and University College London, say they have identified fatty acids that look like good candidates for the job. They found that not only did some of the fatty acids outperform a regular epilepsy medication called valproate in controlling seizures in animals, they also had fewer side-effects. Source: BBC Health Discover how to live safely with epilepsy What do I do if someone has a seizure? But many more tests are needed to determine if the treatment would be safe and effective in humans. Prof Matthew Walker, from the Institute of Neurology, University College London, said: \"Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide and approximately a third of these people have epilepsy that is not adequately controlled by our present treatments. \"This discovery offers a whole new approach to the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsies in children and adults.\" Simon Wigglesworth, deputy chief executive at Epilepsy Action, said: \"We know the ketogenic diet can be a highly effective treatment for children with difficult to control epilepsy and it is starting to be used for adults. \"The diet is high in fats and low in carbohydrates and the balance of the diet needs to be carefully worked out for each child. Although some children manage the diet very well, others find the diet unpleasant and difficult to follow. Children can also experience side-effects including constipation and weight loss. \"The identification of these fatty acids is an exciting breakthrough. The research means that children and adults with epilepsy could potentially benefit from the science behind the ketogenic diet without dramatically altering their eating habits or experiencing unpleasant side-effects. \"We look forward to seeing how this research progresses.\"", "question": "A @placeholder made by the body when it uses fat as fuel could provide a new way of treating epilepsy , experts hope .", "option_0": "change", "option_1": "substance", "option_2": "lifetime", "option_3": "growing", "option_4": "choice", "label": 1}
{"article": "The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the body which oversees the rules of the game, passed the law at a meeting in Zurich. It will come in to force on 1 June, in time for the World Cup in Brazil. The new law was proposed by the Football Association and will apply to domestic and international football. FA general secretary Alex Horne said: \"The idea is to get some consistency. The simplest rule for the image of the game is to start from the basis that slogans will not be allowed.\" From the time the new rule comes in to place, incidents such as Mario Balotelli's infamous \"Why Always Me?\" message, which he revealed after scoring against Manchester United in 2011, will be banned and subject to a sanction. Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke said: \"It is definitely decided that players must not have any slogan or statement, and we are making the decision that it will apply to the World Cup.\" Law 4 of the game, which relates to players' equipment, will be amended. It states: \"Players must not reveal undergarments that show political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturer logo. \"A player/team of a player that reveals an undergarment that shows political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturers' logo will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by Fifa.\" Meanwhile, the IFAB rejected a proposal from Uefa to amend the so-called \"triple punishment\" which occurs when a penalty kick is given within a game, warranting a player being sent off and a possible goal being scored. It was agreed that a pilot project carried out by the FA and Scottish Football Association relating to revolving substitutes in amateur football will continue, as will a Uefa experiment into the use of a sin bin in recreational football. The IFAB also discussed the potential use of video replays for match officials but remains of the view that technology should be allowed only for goal-line incidents because \"it is a clear yes or no decision\".

A Chester Crown Court jury unanimously cleared the couple, from East Sussex. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the couple had been subject to a \"thorough and ethical investigation\". The couple had spent more than two-and-a-half years on bail since being arrested in August 2013 under the NCA's Operation Pallial. It was claimed Mr Jones, 66, took one boy into an office and threw chairs at him while encouraged by Mrs Jones, 63. The couple said the main allegation against them related to 1973 and 1974 when the accuser was aged nine or 10, but during the nine-day trial, jurors heard they did not start working in north Wales until 1975. \"We spent two-and-a-half years of not being able to clear our names and not being able to talk about it,\" said Mrs Jones, who was chief executive of Southdown Housing Association, based in Lewes at the time of her arrest. \"On alleged victims' sites on Facebook and Twitter, people seem to feel they can talk about anything even if it's not factual or just.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device This South Africa team is the poorest we've seen in a long, long time but England still needed to put them away. England hadn't beaten them in 10 years, the weather wasn't ideal and they hadn't played since completing a whitewash over Australia in June, so Saturday's 37-21 victory at Twickenham was a good result. One of the biggest changes since Jones took over last November is the England players' fitness levels. Jones has bags of experience and is speaking to players straight. And one of the things he will have told them is that they won't be great players unless they get fitter. So the players have listened and got fitter. There's a great story about Ben Youngs: the Leicester scrum-half was considered to be overweight, so Jones kept showing him bags of sweets. If you don't get the message after that, you never will. Man of the match Youngs looked sharp against the Springboks. I don't know what Pieter-Steph du Toit's sight is like out of his right eye, because Youngs left him for dead twice with dummies, but Youngs spotted the opportunity and England had support runners on his shoulder both times to finish things off. Billy Vunipola has also been released as a result of improved fitness, while Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes and Chris Robshaw were workaholics. Jones is clever psychologically. During the Six Nations, he kept talking about Robshaw and James Haskell. After Saturday's match, the first person he mentioned was Robshaw. The two back-rows are elder statesmen and he's telling everyone that they're his best players. That's no coincidence. It's a message to the rest of the squad: come and knock these guys off. Jonny May's try was beautifully crafted and executed, a genuine team try. The art of attack is fixing defenders, using dummy runners as smoke and mirrors, getting the ball in behind and finishing things off. At any time that move could have fallen down because of a poor decision or poor execution, but it didn't. The summer tour of Australia went great but they conceded more tries than they scored, which would have been a concern. Jones brought in a specialist defence coach, Jason Ryles, from rugby league outfit Melbourne Storm, and for a lot of the game against South Africa the defence worked reasonably well. There was a drop-off in intensity but that's to be expected given the gap between matches. The intensity will increase in the coming weeks. I like the fact Jones never seems to be happy and keeps saying he wants England to be number one in the world. It won't be easy, and staying number one will be even more difficult than getting there in the first place. But there aren't many positions - the flankers, inside centre, both wings? - that aren't competitive and this is a very good England team in the making. Media playback is not supported on this device To say South African rugby is in crisis is an exaggeration. But they are certainly not in a good situation, given their past status. When players started leaving South Africa, they were often vastly experienced and could adjust well to playing club rugby abroad and returning home for internationals. But bit by bit, those players - people like Bakkies Botha, Victor Matfield, Jannie du Plessis, Schalk Burger, Francois Steyn - have either drifted away, retired or their form has dropped, and nobody has stepped up to replace them. Injuries have hurt them - they've had a host in the back row, including to Francois Louw and Duane Vermuelen - and they've not had a steady half-back partnership for the last few years. You're always going to struggle for stability and consistency if you don't have that. Media playback is not supported on this device You've got to feel for Scotland - they will be hurting. Again. The win over Australia was theirs and the celebrations were on ice. But it all melted away in slightly unspectacular fashion. Australia were down to 14 men, with Will Skelton in the sin-bin, but Scotland didn't play the percentages and the territory as they should have. As a result, Tevita Kuridrani ended up blasting through a couple of tackles - poor old Peter Horne is not going to be able to watch that replay - and scoring under the posts. But Scotland did play some decent rugby. The Gray brothers, Jonny and Richie, were everywhere, between them they made 40-odd tackles and didn't miss one. And Jonny Gray in particular never seemed to be without the ball in his hands. Glasgow fly-half Finn Russell is young and fearless and has some nice, deft touches. The fact that he's already got 20 caps to his name and is only 24 is good for the team. Outside him, Huw Jones' first try showed great speed and change of direction, while the second showed how explosive he can be in a tight, confined space. I'm looking forward to seeing more of him. Vern Cotter's side are waiting to click, and a victory over Australia might just have released them. It certainly would have locked away a few ghosts, following on from their last-gasp defeat by the Wallabies at last year's World Cup. Scotland should expect to beat Argentina next week, despite the Pumas being ranked three places above them in sixth. They should certainly embrace the pressure of playing at home and not be afraid to expect to win. Argentina will want to make it fast, loose and scary and put the likes of Joaquin Tuculet and Santiago Cordero in space. But Scotland will beat them with a more structured game. Media playback is not supported on this device After last week's poor display against Australia, it was just important for Wales to get a victory against Argentina. It wasn't a performance that made you go \"wow\" but the northern hemisphere sides are just getting back into the swing of things. Argentina are a very good side with some classy, quality players, so Wales were never comfortable and never able to get away from them. But the return of Alun Wyn Jones and Sam Warburton helped keep them cool under pressure. I liked the performance of Ross Moriarty at number eight. The Gloucester man is like a mini-explosion in a collision, whether he's carrying or putting in a tackle. Not many players manage to be that aggressive and maintain control. And if you're not winning collisions, you're going to be on the back foot. Liam Williams was a real livewire on the wing but he needs to get the ball into his hands more often. I'd like to see him play at full-back, because at least then he'd be behind the play, able to see what was happening and get involved, rather than waiting out on the wing for the ball to come to him. Wales are trying to build on what they started 18 months ago, which is using more dummy runners, putting the ball in behind, and looking for space either within that diamond shape or out wide. In the build-up to Williams' try, they got it spot on and Dan Biggar ended up bursting through a gap - and it's not often you hear anyone say that. Most sides can't do it because their fitness doesn't allow them to, but if you can execute it, it's pretty much impossible to stop you. Argentina play a very similar game to New Zealand, except they don't have as many world-class players. So they are going to make more mistakes, which will allow opposition teams to take advantage. When it sticks it's magnificent to watch; when it doesn't it looks as if they don't really know what they're doing. But in Martin Landajo and Nicolas Sanchez they have a formidable half-back partnership and because of the way they play, they were never out of the game. A second-string Ireland side did what they were expected to do against Canada. But it was nice to see Joey Carberry and Gary Ringrose showing what they can do. The Leinster fly-half and centre respectively have great poise and understanding of the game and could be challenging for first-team places soon. When Joe Schmidt took over as head coach in 2013, everyone was taken aback by the impact he had on Irish rugby. They won two Six Nations titles in a row but then big players retired and other teams seemed to have worked them out. Media playback is not supported on this device But Schmidt seems to have rejigged things, Ireland won in Cape Town in the summer and the performance in beating the All Blacks last week was incredible. New Zealand hadn't lost in 18 games and not in 111 years against Ireland. But Ireland showed you can beat them playing a controlled, structured game. You have to be phenomenally fit to implement that game plan and execute perfectly 99% of what you do, and even then New Zealand might only need that 1% to beat you. When it was loose and frenetic in Chicago, the All Blacks ruled the roost. There was a period of New Zealand dominance that stemmed from Sexton kicking the ball out on the full. Ireland struggled to get their foot back on the throat of the snake that was trying to bite them for about 15 minutes and became inhibited. I thought that maybe Ireland were gone, but they didn't freeze for long, maybe because they have been in the same situation in recent years and knew what they had to do. But a repeat result in Dublin would be even better than their first, because it's not as if New Zealand have suddenly fallen off a cliff.", "question": "Every coach has high standards but I think England boss Eddie Jones ' standards are higher than almost anybody 's .

{"article": "On the economic front, he's got some work to do. It's not that the US economy is in such bad shape. It's recovered better than the UK one. The problem is more that he has portrayed it as being wrecked, and he has raised expectations of doubling the growth rate to 4%, while \"bringing millions of jobs back to America\". \"We're going to win so much. You're going to get sick and tired of winning. You're gonna be saying, Mr President, enough with the winning.\" The Texans talk about blowhards as being \"all hat, but no cattle\". Well, Donald Trump has certainly done the hat bit. So now... ? The economic plan is threadbare, and it's not clear who is going to be driving it in the Trump administration. Over at the US Fed, it could get a bit wobbly, as the president-elect is not a big fan of Janet Yellen or her management of monetary policy, and he may want her replaced. The key elements are a big push on infrastructure, particularly in transport: \"Believe me, it'll be second to none.\" Good news for the construction sector. Market pundits are also talking up healthcare stocks, as Trump and his Republican allies set about dismantling Obamacare. There are profits to be made out of the wreckage there. You might also buy shares in the coal-mining industry, which has been tanking of late, and it's collapsed almost entirely on this side of the Pond. Targeting votes in rustbelt and mining states such as West Virginia, Candidate Trump went big on the prospects for reviving coal production. Yes, it's dirty, but the president-elect believes climate change is \"a hoax\" perpetrated by the Chinese. So that could upend a lot of the growing green economy in the US. And if eight years of Obama's climate change policy is to be thrown into reverse, repudiation of the commitments made to international limits on carbon emissions could entice signatories into doing the same. But the bit that gives the markets the jitters is trade. It's been the signature element of his populist pitch - that the governing elite have signed up to trade deals that have neglected the interests of Ordinary Joe. The signs have been there for a long time, but they are clearest in the stagnation of real earnings since the 1970s, and the reduced share of the economic pie that's gone to wages. The Trump Movement has, as its foundation, the giant shift in manufacturing and economic power, particularly to Asia. And there are clear parallels there with the de-industrialisation and hollowing out of much of the north of England, which led to the vote for Brexit. So the big question is what he is going to do about trade? Repudiating deals? Tearing them up? Imposing punitive tariffs in economic warfare? Or seeking to re-negotiate, with a mandate from the American people and the one trademark skill that he brings to the White House - deal-making. The UK will be looking for a post-Brexit deal with the US. Trump has sounded more positive about that than others in Washington. But what kind of deal would it be? The basis for international trading is that all sides win. The catch is that it can require painful adjustment within countries. Donald Trump doesn't like that adjustment, so the rhetoric points to a trade deal that is strongly favourable to Americans over its trading partners. Also worth watching in his economic policy is the approach to taxation and spending. He has said he wants to lower tax on high earners and to simplify federal tax bands to three levels: 12%, 25% and 33%. He also wants to cut headline corporation tax from 35% to 15%. That's not much below the level at which the UK Treasury has been aiming, and it's higher than Ireland's corporation tax rate. That could stimulate growth. But tax experts in Washington think, with the promises on infrastructure and defence spending, that it will instead make the federal debt balloon, by perhaps more than $5 trillion. That helps explain why the mighty US dollar is not in its customary role, acting as the safe haven for investors. The Japanese yen and the Swiss franc look more solid now. But it raises the question of how much of this plan President Trump can get through Congress. He may be a Republican, but he's far from sharing the fiscal conservatism of his party's representatives on the Hill.  Given their differences and Trump's mandate having been achieved without them, that relationship is going to take a lot of managing. What will also require managing is the Trump business portfolio. Unlike other presidents and prime ministers, he does not intend to put it into a blind trust. How could he, when the Trump brand is so prominent on his property and business interests? So his family will continue to manage it. And as he's proven already to be a rather divisive character, they may have their work cut out to secure these Trump assets. From the bling and buildings in the US to his golf courses north of Aberdeen and at Turnberry in Ayrshire, these are now extensions of the presidential brand. The Commander-in-Chief will surely want them to be protected as such.", "question": "It 's hard to know where to start with the @placeholder that is president - elect Donald J Trump .

Tui is also worried about the effect of migrants on its Greek business. Since the attack in Tunisia, the Foreign Office now advises against all but essential travel to the country. \"This is the most tragic event and loss of human life that I have ever had to deal with or my company and we remain deeply shocked in terms of the loss of life, those customers that were injured and all the trauma that our customers had to go through, through these terrible events,\" Tui Group chief executive Peter Long told the BBC. \"We were 100% focused on making sure that our customers were looked after and that was our number one priority.\" He also said that the company was reliant on Foreign Office advice on when to resume offering holidays in Tunisia. The company said that in the three months to the end of June the attack had caused repatriation and cancellation costs of about \u20ac10m ($11m; \u00a37m). Tui also said it had been hit by the continued economic turmoil in Greece, which made withdrawing cash from banks more difficult. Mr Long said he thought it was time for other European governments to help Greece deal with migrants arriving at Greek islands, especially from Syria. \"We know that tourism for Greece is so important, their economy is fragile and what we don't want to see [is] a deteriorating demand from our customers going to the Greek islands.\" However, Tui said that business had been resilient and that summer bookings were still ahead of last year's level.

{"article": "The film will \"document the journey from the moment in 1991 when Noel Gallagher joined his brother Liam's band\" to their acrimonious split. According to a statement, the film-makers have been given \"unprecedented access\" to the band and their archives. Amy director Asif Kapadia has taken a production role on the film. Mat Whitecross will direct, having previously made the Stone Roses' film Spike Island - a fictional story about a wannabe rock band who tried to get their demo tape into the hands of their idols at their seminal outdoor show near Widnes. He also won acclaim for Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll, his whimsical, mischievous biopic of punk pioneer Ian Dury, with a head-turning central performance by Andy Serkis. Amy broke box-office records on its release earlier this year, eventually becoming the highest-grossing British documentary of all time, with takings of \u00c2\u00a35.4 million. Oasis's story is less tragic and much more convoluted. Initially called Rain, they were signed to Alan McGee's Creation Records in 1993. A year later their debut album, Definitely Maybe topped the charts  - but the Gallagher brothers' fractious relationship was already a story. In September 1994, Noel walked out of the band after Liam made offensive remarks about American audiences, hitting him over the head with a tambourine during a Los Angeles gig. They reconciled to record the career-defining album (What's The Story) Morning Glory and, by 1996, were able to play two sold-out gigs at Knebworth, watched by 250,000 fans. Over the next decade, the band scored eight UK number one singles, 15 NME Awards, five Brit Awards, nine Q Awards and four MTV Europe Music Awards. But there was a constant backdrop of squabbles and in-fighting.

{"article": "The highest rise of \u00a365 in Somerset is partly due to a one-year interim levy for flood defence work. North Somerset's council tax is likely to go up by \u00a353 for a Band D property after a freeze for the past few years. Deputy leader, Elfan Ap Rees said: \"I'm disappointed the government hasn't really been listening to all of the councils all of the time.\" The expected rises are: Gloucestershire \u00a353; Bristol \u00a360; South Gloucestershire \u00a360; Wiltshire \u00a352; Swindon \u00a349 and Bath and North East Somerset \u00a342. They all take into account police and fire services which are also expected to put up their share of the council tax bill. For the county council areas, there may also be further increases added in to the council tax bill from the town and parish councils precepts. West Somerset Council merged its services with neighbouring Taunton Deane to cut down on expenditure in 2013. West Somerset's Conservative leader, Anthony Trollope-Bellew said: \"Our projections are we will not be able to produced a balanced budget in 2018-19. \"How are we going to deal with that? Well we are starting to try and deal with it now, we've got two years to try to sort it out.\" The councils will be setting their budgets in February and March, ahead of the new financial year. Once the budget is set, the council tax rises will be confirmed. BBC Points West Political editor, Paul Barltrop: We're all going to pay more and get less for years to come. That is the picture emerging from our councils as they grapple with further reductions in the funding they get from central government. It has been falling for years, but the obvious savings - like being more efficient and having fewer offices and staff - have been made. So there is quiet relief in many corners of the West that the government's had a change of heart, and is pretty much expecting councils to put up tax. That may not go down well with residents, but they may have to get used to it. The expectation is that putting up tax by around a pound a week will be the norm in the next few years. Not that it will make life easy for our councillors.

{"article": "The same can hardly be said for the surrounding area. It has the usual transport terminal trappings: rundown hotels, greasy fast-food joints and taxis whose meters may or may not correctly reflect the tariff. Behind the station there is a railway yard with graffiti-daubed, rotting rolling stock obstructing access to the Sava riverfront, just a matter of metres away. But all this is set to change. A massive hoarding on the front of the station depicts a future which seems to have beamed in from a parallel universe - or, at the very least, a different country. It features a gleaming tower surrounded by shops and parks on the banks of the river. And underneath, the logo and contact details for the Belgrade Waterfront development. \"Belgrade Waterfront is a project for which the city has waited for more than 50 years,\" says Milutin Folic, the head of Belgrade's city planning department. \"After the Second World War, we had plans to relocate the train and bus stations and free the important and central area of brownfield for the city to expand towards the rivers. With Belgrade Waterfront, a city which sits on two rivers will finally reach the water. \"It will bring urban ideas to daylight, put the construction industry back on its feet - and we hope other parts of the economy will see the benefits.\" The entire project is worth more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn (\u00c2\u00a32.3bn; $3.4bn) - and could take 30 years to complete. By its end, Belgrade should have a new opera house, shopping centre and luxury hotels and apartments. There should also be much-improved access to the riverfront, currently a glaringly underused resource. But support for Belgrade Waterfront is far from universal. Initially, reservations focused on the recent revival of the riverfront Savamala district, which overlaps the area under development. It has become a cultural hub, with galleries, arts centres and nightlife attracting crowds of overseas and local visitors. Its supporters fear that some or all of this might be lost in the fervour to revamp the city. Then there were concerns over the bidding process - or rather, the lack of one. The government and city authorities simply appointed Eagle Hills, a developer based in Abu Dhabi, the source of the funding for the project. Opponents say it is far from clear how Belgrade Waterfront's costs will be met. \"The government said there would be no tender because 'we have the best investor already'. They just announced it would be done this way and covered it by changing the laws where necessary or just ignoring them where they couldn't change them,\" says Luka Knezevic Strika, a visual artist who opposes Belgrade Waterfront. \"I don't mind cleaning up the trash - but not when the price is giving away the land where the trash stood. Making expensive housing doesn't have any benefit to the citizens. Leaving it as it was would have been better - we would have been richer for a future when we could have developed it as we wanted.\" This partly explains why a crowd of thousands is spending the early part of their Saturday evening gathering in front of Belgrade City Hall, blowing whistles and waving flags emblazoned with a cartoon of a yellow rubber duck. \"The word duck in Serbian means fraud,\" explains Luka Knezevic Strika. \"It's a symbolic way of saying the project is really Belgrade Water-fraud.\" But it is not just the lack of transparency that concerns the campaigners. They were formerly a small but determined group who called themselves Ne Davimo Beograd (\"Don't Drown Belgrade\"), but their numbers have swollen since a bizarre and disturbing incident at the end of April. Just hours after polls closed in the general election, masked men armed with baseball bats enforced the overnight demolition of several Savamala buildings that stood in the way of Belgrade Waterfront. Thousands of outraged citizens joined the Ne Davimo Beograd campaigners in a series of protests before Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic admitted, at the start of June, that city officials were behind the episode. \"I'm afraid for the system when events like this happen,\" says Knezevic Strika. \"There can't be good intentions behind something that turns out to be government-sponsored terrorism.\" The incident has also overshadowed Belgrade's dire need for economic stimulus and infrastructure development. This city of two million has long been one of the largest, most important and vibrant in south-east Europe. But the past 25 years have not been kind. The violent disintegration of Yugoslavia brought an international embargo and hyperinflation, as well as Nato bombs. Then just as newly independent Serbia was emerging from the literal and metaphorical rubble, the European financial crisis hit it particularly hard. James Thornley, senior partner at the Belgrade office of auditors KPMG, says there is a good business case for a development like Belgrade Waterfront. \"Everything stopped on commercial development 10 years ago, and now there's a shortage. If a major investor came to us and asked where they could locate 500 or 1,000 people, we would struggle to advise them. \"There really is potentially a demand for what's being offered - opportunities for the place to be a hub where people can live and work have to be a positive thing.\" Some changes are already apparent. Riverfront renovations have produced a promenade with playgrounds, a beach volleyball court, and food and drink outlets. It is already well used by a mix of families, cyclists and cocktail drinkers. Meanwhile, construction of the Belgrade Tower and the high-end W Hotel can be seen through transparent windows on nearby hoardings. Belgrade's planning chief, Milutin Folic, sees it as a clear improvement for citizens. \"The balance is so far in favour of the project - it really changes the area in a positive direction. It's not like we're destroying an historical area and building something new. We're actually not destroying anything - we're turning brownfield into an urban area,\" he says. While the new riverside leisure area already seems a popular success, the protests are likely to continue. People in Serbia have learned to be deeply suspicious - after decades of dodgy sell-offs and promises that all too frequently have come to nothing. At the very least, Belgrade Waterfront now needs to do a lot of bridge-building to show it is not going to fall into that category as well.

There are now 16 players on the deals which see the Welsh Rugby Union pay 60% of their wages. The contracts also give the governing body greater control over the players, and can limit the number of games they play. Warburton is one of only two Blues on the joint deals with utility back Gareth Anscombe the other. Blues wing Alex Cuthbert turned down an offer of a contract during the 2014-15 campaign, according to Wales coach Warren Gatland, prompting speculation about his long-term future. Fly-half Rhys Patchell is also being linked with a move away from Blues. Warburton insists his heart is with the city of his upbringing and where he used to watch Wales and Cardiff predecessors Martyn Williams and Robin Sowden-Taylor play. \"I remember watching Dan Baugh playing when I was really young,\" said Warburton before Saturday's 35-30 Pro12 defeat by Glasgow. \"I didn't really know many players then and I remember seeing this guy with his collars tucked in and his socks down, just taking people's heads off and I was like 'I want to do that.

Liberty said it hoped to re-employ some ex-Tata employees who lost their jobs when the plants were mothballed by Tata last October. However, applications are also being encouraged from those looking to join the steel industry for the first time. Liberty said it planned to offer apprenticeship opportunities, including modern apprenticeships in engineering, finance and commercial planning.

{"article": "Retail sales grew by 5.9% compared with July 2015, the Office for National Statistics said. \"Better weather this year could be a major factor, with sales of clothing and footwear doing particularly well,\" said Joe Grice of the ONS. He added that there was anecdotal evidence suggesting the weaker pound encouraged overseas visitors to spend. Sales of watches and jewellery were up 16.6% in July compared with the same month last year - the biggest jump in nearly two years. Compared with June, UK retail sales were up 1.4%, a figure that was much stronger than expected. Sterling climbed almost a cent against the dollar after publication of the figures. The retail data went against expectations of an immediate hit to consumer confidence from the UK's vote to leave the European Union. Other figures released earlier this week also showed little immediate impact of the Brexit vote on the labour market, but there were signs of inflation pressures building after the plunge in sterling, which could diminish the spending power of households. Dennis de Jong of UFX.com said: \"The High Street certainly hasn't taken as big a hit as many had predicted in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, but retailers will still have concerns about what lies ahead over the next few months. \"The government won't be celebrating just yet, as they will need to see more evidence that consumers are continuing to reach for their wallets as the effects of Brexit become clearer.\" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics said that \"consumers' blissful ignorance won't last long\". \"July's retail sales figures show that consumers have been protected from the immediate fallout of the Brexit vote, but with firms intending to stop hiring and inflation set to soar, the High Street is set for a tough year,\" he said. \"The real test for consumer spending lies in 2017 when jobs cuts will kick in and inflation will erode spending power,\" Mr Tombs added. The Bank of England more than halved its forecasts for household spending growth over the next two years after the vote to leave the EU.

There was no doubt as Morecambe took a surprise lead after 24 minutes. A scruffy first touch for skipper Murphy worked in his favour, presenting him with space to curl a fine effort past Ian Lawlor. Doncaster emerged for the second half with more urgency and James Coppinger curled wide from 20 yards before Conor Grant clipped a free-kick over the crossbar. Rovers finally levelled after 56 minutes when Marquis deftly side-footed home from 12 yards.

When the build is completed in May it will house a kitchen and additional living space in an open plan format. Yet, surveying the spick and span surroundings, James doesn't look happy. \"It's a bit of a mess,\" he frowns. James is a stickler for tidiness. But there's a very practical reason behind his insistence on perfection. \"I'm registered blind, it's a condition called retinitis pigmentosa,\" he says. \"I basically have 10% sight but with no peripheral vision. \"It's like looking through a letterbox or a viewfinder in a camera. Because my sight is so poor there can't be anything lying around for me to trip over.\" James, 48, has worked in construction since he was 18. He first noticed a problem with his sight in his early 20s. \"I tried to get on with my job on a building site, but my eyes kept getting worse. At night I couldn't see at all. \"I tried to ignore it but it started to impact on my work. When I was on sites as part of a team, we were paid by how many bricks we laid and I was getting slower and slower because I couldn't see properly. It was hampering my colleagues.\" He was forced to rethink his direction within the industry and in the end he managed to turn a negative into a positive. \"Because my sight was so bad, my organisation had to be good. I thought ahead, tried to anticipate problems.\" James made the transition from hands-on building to project managing, eventually starting his own firm, contracting out construction workers to other jobs. Then in 2007, came his Eureka moment. \"I was sitting at home in my conservatory, shivering. It was expensive but inefficient. In the winter it was freezing and in the summer, when the sun hit the windows it was like having a magnifying glass on the back of the house. \"I thought I could do better and that's where the idea for my business came in. I designed a conservatory with no thermal break - it's not a separate space and is integrated into the house which allows it to retain heat.\" Unlike a traditional conservatory which has a glass roof and walls, his garden rooms have a solid roof and walls. He adds: \"We use specially made glass with a gas field and it's often triple glazed.\" The builds aren't cheap, starting at around \u00a340,000 and going up to more than \u00a3100,000 for bespoke versions. Most customers come to James because they either want to stay in their current properties or cannot afford to move somewhere bigger. And this kind of market is expanding. In 2014 the company expects to turn over \u00a3500,000, doubling in 2015 and again in 2016. As the business has grown and James's sight has deteriorated, he's had to constantly adapt the way he works. Since 2013, he has employed an old friend Paul Allen to act as \"his eyes\" on site. \"I drive James to sites, help him check over work, pick up building materials from the merchants and so on,\" says Paul. \"If a ladder hasn't been propped up properly, or if there's scaffolding around, I need to warn him. \"If he goes off sick we're all in trouble!\" Paul also supports James in ways not related to his sight: \"We trust each other and he bounces ideas off me for a second opinion.\" In the next couple of years James wants to expand the business but is not going down the conventional banking route. Instead he's using existing capital in the business, as well as \u00a350,000 he was awarded for winning the 2013 Stelios Award for Disabled Entrepreneurs. Yet James says he prefers to describe himself in another way. \"I think of myself as a para-entrepreneur - different rather than disabled. When you're in London, the chap standing on the tallest column in Trafalgar Square has got one arm and one eye but we don't ever think of Lord Nelson as being disabled, he's just Lord Nelson.\" In 2012 one of the company's projects was shortlisted for the International Design and Architecture Awards. The competition was open to entrants from across the industry and did not take into account James's sight problems. And James believes that when customers are parting with thousands of pounds, they're not going to take into account the fact that he's got a disability. \"We're selling our product in the mainstream and asking customers to spend their taxed income. They don't get a grant for buying from us,\" he says. \"Customers don't care whether I have a disability or not, as long as we get the job done.\" For more on this story, listen to On the Money on BBC Radio 5 live on Sunday, 23 March at 19:30 GMT, or catch up on the BBC iPlayer.", "question": "An expanse of smooth concrete , neatly @placeholder bricks and barely a speck of dust in sight - this is not your average building site .", "option_0": "finds", "option_1": "embodied", "option_2": "trimmed", "option_3": "piled", "option_4": "spaced", "label": 3}

{"article": "Even though the plans are very much in the early stages there have already been a few rows, so it's clear many months of negotiation lie ahead. All the bids talk about district and county councils working more closely together along with local business groups. Some hint at cross-border partnerships. The Suffolk bid looks the most impressive so far. Its glossy publication, Working for a Better Future, sets out the benefits which devolution could bring: 70,000 new homes by 2031, the creation of 5,000 new apprenticeships and the creation of better jobs to help reduce money spent on benefits. It talks about a joined up strategic Suffolk plan and setting up a local employment service to administer universal credit. It also wants the county, rather than Whitehall, to decide how European structural funds and money for transport are spent and it asks for local control of health services. In the bid's introduction Jennie Jenkins, the leader of Babergh Council, said: \"We have chosen to set aside our differences and focus on what's important - making people's lives better.\" The Greater Essex bid also has ambitious plans. Signed by all 15 authorities, it aims to create the fastest growing economy outside London, increasing  economic output from \u00c2\u00a332.5bn to \u00c2\u00a360bn and increasing exports by 100%. County Council leader David Finch said: \"For too long the decisions which impact on the needs and aspirations of the people and businesses in Essex have been taken in Whitehall.  With our local knowledge and democratic accountability we can do better.\" Power sharing Norfolk's bid talks about: \"An exciting proposal that will transform the economy of East Anglia\". It is more vague about how devolution would work, but among its suggestions is the creation of a productivity commission which would look at plugging the skills gap, particularly in rural areas. The Norfolk bid also talks about a wish to work more closely and share powers with Suffolk and perhaps even Cambridgeshire over things like flood protection and the development of road and rail links. At the moment all the councils are pushing a county only solution but they may have to consider something more ambitious. There is concern that compared to London and the so-called Northern Power House, the government may feel that Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk are too small and giving devolution to individual counties may not be very efficient. That's why there's a lot of talk about counties merging in some form or other. A county of East Anglia may suit ministers but what would happen to local accountability? Other questions are up for discussion: If councils are sharing services do we really need district and county councils? What happens in places like Norwich, Ipswich and Southend-on-Sea, where there are city deals? Could more services be run locally instead of from Whitehall? A new start? This could be the start of something big, leading to a change in the way our local government is structured, perhaps even in how we're governed. Some people in local government are concerned. We understand there were several heated discussions leading up to the publication of these bids. There are likely to be many more in the months to come. Devolution is going to be the buzz word for the next few years. The government is keen to encourage regional autonomy, while councils are having to make big savings to their budgets and some believe the two are not unrelated - relieving Whitehall of the burden of wielding the axe. There are plenty of people who think it would benefit the east, but coming up with plans that will be acceptable to government, councils and local voters is likely to take some time.", "question": "The first steps have been taken towards devolution in the eastern @placeholder .

It was billed as Wales' biggest game since the 1958 World Cup. The team will now play Portugal in Lyon on Wednesday. In an exhilarating game in northern France, Wales went one better than their 1958 predecessors who reached the last eight of the World Cup. However, the game got off to a tense start after Wales fell behind to Radja Nainggolan's strike in the first 15 minutes. But the team thundered back with Ashley Williams, Hal Robson-Kanu and substitute Sam Vokes proving the goal-scoring heroes. Thousands of Wales fans travelled to Lille for the quarter-final match, with many congregating in the fan zone. Some had faced hours of travel delays at the Eurotunnel to reach the stadium. After the final whistle, Neil Davies, 49, from south Wales, said Wales had played \"brilliantly\" and he had tears in his eyes. He said: \"I thought if Belgium went 1-0 up then that would be it. They did and I thought that's us done. To come back the way we did - unbelievable.\" Paula Hart, 41, from Swansea, said: \"It's just been immense. The Belgian fans have been the best, so fair play to them. \"I'm now thinking about the final. Portugal haven't been great so why not start thinking about it?\" Julian Richards, 31, of Pontypool, said: \"It feels absolutely fantastic. \"What we've had in the quarter-final and what I think we'll have in the semi-final is belief. Belief breeds confidence.\" Mr Richards, who was in the Lille fan zone, said: \"One thing I will say is Belgian fans, best in the world.\" He took his 14-year-old son, Joel, to Lille and he said the Belgian fans had given him flags and glasses. Geraint Thomas, 51, of Menai Bridge, Anglesey, said: \"Here with the proper fans [in the fan zone] it's worth the \u00c2\u00a3200 you would have to pay for a ticket.\" And he was unequivocal about where Wales were headed in Euro 2016. \"Next weekend we've going to the final.

{"article": "When Lib Dem MPs and Lords and members of the Federal Executive gathered to endorse the coalition agreement at Local Government House, Paddy Ashdown backed it, Ming Campbell gave it his blessing; even radical Liberals like Duncan Brack backed the deal with the Conservatives. When it came to a vote just one hand was raised against the agreement. And until now the former MP for Newbury in Berkshire, David Rendel, has not talked about what was a private meeting, but after the local elections he sat down to talk on camera about the reasons why he felt he had to withhold his endorsement. \"It was very lonely being on my own.  I was with a group of about 250 people - all of whom I liked and respected. \"But I said in my speech that I felt this was a short-term government and all we would get would be short-term gains. Come the next election there was every chance we would go back to a minority government and any gains would be wiped out.\" Alone amongst those in the room he concluded that the reaction of the public was not worth the compromise. Lib Dem voters stated conclusively last week that they felt the party was on a train heading in a completely different direction to the ticket they bought.  Now they were hitched to the Conservative engine where previously the third party vote could have many different destinations. Rendel calls the loss of the referendum on electoral reform \"a disaster\" and feels most betrayed by the tuition fee policy. As Higher Education spokesman in Parliament he argued against the introduction of fees by Labour.  Now he says: \"I felt bitterly disappointed by the hash that we made of tuition fees, in so many ways.\" But now he thinks the coalition must continue. \"I don't think there's any point now in ending the coalition at this stage. If we did we would simply lose all the quicker all the short-term gains we have made. \"I think the coalition's got to face up to the fact that the depth, strength and speed at which these cuts have been made is, I think, damaging the recovery.\" As to Nick Clegg's own position as leader, it is difficult to see any Liberal Democrat justifying turning on the man who managed to get such an overwhelming number of party members behind his policies. The decision was also endorsed by a special party conference on 16 May 2010 where it was reported that only 50 voted against out of a total of some 1,500 delegates. But David Rendel will always remember the day he was the only man to stand against the prevailing mood of his party. \"I felt very lonely indeed. You can feel lonelier, I think, when you are standing up amongst colleagues and friends and opposing what they want to do, than you would if you were among enemies and opposing what they want to do.\" \"I felt I was not exactly betraying my friends but clearly I was doing something they would rather I didn't do - and it is never fun to oppose people who you believe in and agree with for the most part, and trust and respect.\"", "question": "A year ago most Liberal Democrat politicians were feeling pleased with themselves .

{"article": "Elizabeth Tracey Mae Wettlaufer of Woodstock, Ontario, appeared in court on Tuesday morning. The victims were residents in two long-term care facilities where Ms Wettlaufer worked and were between 75 and 96 years old. Police said seven of the victims were given a fatal dose of a drug. The victims were five women and three men and were all residents of Caressant Care in Woodstock and Meadow Park in London, Ontario. What we know about accused Canadian nurse \"The victims were administered a drug... there are obviously a number of drugs that are stored and are available in long-term care facilities,\" Woodstock Police Chief William Renton said at a news conference. The chief declined to comment on a possible motive, but did add that investigators are confident that they have identified all victims. Caressant spokesman Lee Griffi said the accused was a registered nurse and left their employment approximately two and a half years ago. \"We deeply regret the additional grief and stress this is imposing on the families involved,\" Mr Griffi said in a written statement. Woodstock is a car industry and agricultural town of some 37,000 people, about 128km (79 miles) west of Toronto. In the residential neighbourhood where the Caressant Care facility is located, few people were seen coming and going. Media were staked outside the property, across from a local school. In the hallway of the adjoining retirement residence, a television could be heard playing the news of Ms Wettlaufer's arrest. An employee at the facility, who was not authorised to speak on the record, told a reporter that it was a shame the actions of one person could colour a whole profession. Ms Wettlaufer was also an employee at Christian Horizons, the long-term care facility confirmed. A spokesperson for the organisation, which was not named in the police investigation, said she stopped working for them in 2007. \"Christian Horizons fully intends to cooperate with the authorities in their investigation in this matter,\" said chief executive Janet Noel-Annable in a statement. The daughter of one of the victims said she felt something was amiss when her father, Aprad Horwath, died at 75 in the Meadow Park facility. \"You don't want to believe any of this until you get to this stage when you're actually hearing it on the radio, and then you know that it's real, and even then it's hard to believe,\" Susan Horvath told AM980 radio in London, Ontario. \"I wanted to talk and just for my dad so that people know what happened to him instead of putting it down as, 'oh he had a stroke' or, 'oh, the old age'.\" Ms Wettlaufer says on her Facebook profile that she studied religious education at London Baptist Bible College before she went to nursing school at Conestoga College in Kitchener, Ontario. She lists Lifeguard Homecare as her current employer. A representative from Lifeguard Homecare has yet to respond to the BBC's calls. On the College of Nurses of Ontario website, Ms Wettlaufer's profile states that she became a registered nurse in August 1995 and then resigned on 30 September 2016. The profile also lists Parker as her former surname, and has recently been updated to note that she is facing murder charges and is remanded in custody. Ms Wettlaufer frequently posted pictures of herself on social media with her elderly parents, and described her passion for animals and the Harry Potter series. \"Father's day is a great reminder of how blessed I am to still have my Dad alive and able to spend time with me\", she wrote beneath a picture of her father. In another post, dated 28 September 2015, Ms Werrlaufer spoke about her difficulties overcoming alcoholism. \"My own voice called to me in the darkness. Others hands lifted me when I chose the light.

Ministers say they cannot guarantee EU nationals living in the UK the right to stay without reciprocal assurances. But Labour's Chuka Umunna said this stance was now just a \"pretence\". Prime Minister Theresa May has said she would expect to guarantee all EU citizens currently living in the UK the right to remain after the UK leaves the EU but this will depend on other EU countries offering similar assurances to British citizens living there. Campaigners say this means the two million EU citizens estimated to be living in the UK have been effectively \"left in limbo\" and they must not be used as \"bargaining chips\" in Brexit discussions over issues such as free movement and access to the single market. Giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee for the first time since he was appointed in July, Mr Goodwill said EU nationals made a major contribution to the UK economy and society - in areas such as the health service and agriculture - and he could not envisage a circumstance in which they were told to go home. Pressed by Mr Umunna, he said the government did not have the means of tracking down all EU nationals were it deemed necessary to remove them. \"No we are not in a position and I could not foresee a circumstance where we would want to be in that position,\" he said. \"I can't see a situation in which we would even think of that.\" Citizens of other EU countries living in the UK who are not working do not necessarily have national insurance numbers, resulting in gaps in the official records. Mr Umunna said the disclosure that the UK government \"did not have a clue\" about the number or identity of EU nationals undermined the government's whole public position and ministers should stop \"carrying on with the pretence\" that they had the ability to ask all EU nationals to leave. \"If you can't identify all the EU nationals in our country and be in a position to remove them, what on earth is the point carrying on with the pretence that somehow if you weren't to guarantee them the right to stay, you could get rid of them,\" he said. Mr Goodwill replied: \"I can see the sort of route you are trying to take me down but it is not a route I think we are ever going to be going down.\" The unwillingness of the government to offer a concrete guarantee to EU nationals was not a \"bargaining ploy\" but a reflection of \"how things are\" pending the start of official negotiations, he said. But he added that he couldn't see countries like Poland clamouring \"to have their nationals returned\" as part of the Brexit deal. Earlier, Mr Goodwill said the government had not decided yet whether to introduce a cut-off point after which any automatic right to stay would no longer apply. He said a number of options existed, including the date of the EU referendum, the day on which Article 50 was triggered or the day on which the UK actually left the EU.

Reedie's future at the agency has been called into question just days before he stands for re-election. But the 75-year-old Briton told BBC Sport he would fight on as \"the integrity of sport is at stake\". Tensions over Wada's attempt to get Russia banned from the Rio Olympics were laid bare at this week's general assembly of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC). \"There was irritation from a number of national Olympic committees,\" said Reedie, who is also a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). \"Just before Rio they would rather sport had not been involved in accusations of the breaching of rules by the Russian authorities, and I understand that, so I had to deal with it and I did deal with it.\" IOC president Thomas Bach told BBC Sport this week he has \"no regrets\" about letting Russia compete at Rio 2016. Media playback is not supported on this device But ANOC president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah - an influential powerbroker in the Olympic movement - has called for a \"neutral\" leader to take charge of Wada. Reedie is due to stand unopposed for a second three-year term at a Wada board meeting this weekend. He had been told he had the IOC's support. \"I've spent 15 years of my life working with Wada,\" he said. \"I don't think it's a particularly good idea if I walk away from it simply because it's getting difficult. \"We've been faced with a difficult situation. I think we're going to come through it, and we have to. The integrity of sport is at stake.\" The Olympic movement is bracing itself for the release next month of a second independent Wada report by professor Richard McLaren into Russian doping. His first report was damning, revealing a systematic cheating programme in the country across many sports. \"If, about three and a half years ago, when I was invited to apply [to be Wada president], somebody had told me this would have happened, it maybe isn't the kind of job that you would volunteer for,\" said Reedie. \"That having been said, there are serious issues involved here. \"The past has been pretty dreadful. I'm really hopeful that once we get the second part of the McLaren report out of the way, we can draw a line under the past and move forward. \"We have to get the Russian anti-doping agency properly compliant again and we need to look at what Wada is currently doing, and see if we can do it better.\" Wada's board meeting in Glasgow this weekend could be pivotal in the debate about how to better protect clean sport following the recent Russian scandal. Many within the anti-doping community want Wada to be strengthened, with greater independence and sanctioning power. However, the sports movement appears reluctant to hand Wada more authority, with Bach suggesting he wants a new Wada-run body to take on responsibility for testing as well as regulation.

Following his previous record breaking attempt last month, Mr McKeown vowed to go faster and was invited to the Elvington World Wheelie Records Straightliners event on Sunday. \"It was the first time I've actually been scared driving that thing,\" he said. \"I was quite nervous going out, but when I realised how close I was to getting over 70mph as an average, I thought I'd have to push the boat out a bit and take a bit more of a risk and it paid off.\" Mr McKeown has modified the shopping trolley since his last attempt to include an extra 250cc Honda engine, which works along side the original jet engine. \"I knew I could go faster, so it was actually quite frustrating before. This shows I'm true to my word,\" he said. Describing travelling at over 70mph on the back of the trolley he said: \"Everything about it gets very twitchy and unpredictable the faster you go, and the stability drops off dramatically, so going out there and pushing over 60mph on the first run, was very, very sketchy. \"I remember going out for the final run and thinking this could genuinely go very wrong and be quite painful. I was just pleased to get back to the pits in one piece.\" The record attempt had to be carried out more than once and Guinness World Records will accept the average speed. Mr McKeown is now submitting evidence of the attempt and hopes the record will soon be made official. He said he will not be making any further world record attempts on the trolley, but is now turning his attention to a motorised wheelbarrow. \"We have done what we set out to achieve, gone faster than the national speed limit, that was the magic figure, 70mph,\" he said.", "question": "A man has broken the national speed limit travelling on a jet - @placeholder shopping trolley .", "option_0": "packed", "option_1": "rated", "option_2": "set", "option_3": "propelled", "option_4": "black", "label": 3}

{"article": "The Garden Bridge Trust needs to raise an estimated \u00a3185m to complete the project. But its latest annual accounts show a shortfall of \u00a356m. However, Garden Bridge Trust chair Lord Davies said trustees still expected construction to start this year. The trust's accounts for 2016 filed with Companies House show it has yet to secure the land on the South Bank of the Thames for the bridge's southern landing. They also show that the trust may need additional funding that would not be repayable \"if the project is not able to proceed\" in the first half of this year. And the accounts raise the possibility that \"in a worst-case scenario\" the trust might have to consider \"whether the project remains viable\". If the project does not go ahead, London mayor Sadiq Khan has estimated that \u00a340m of public money already spent would be lost to taxpayers. In total the trust said it had received financial commitments totalling \u00a3129m from private investors, donors or public funds. Of that, \u00a360m is to come from the Department of Transport and Transport for London (TfL), \u00a320m of which will be repaid to TfL by the trust over time. But of the \u00a339m raised in 2016 for the project, \u00a326m came from the DfT, meaning the trust raised only \u00a313m last year. In the accounts, Lord Davies warns: \"Due to material uncertainties in existence ahead of finalising these accounts trustees are unable to conclude that the trust is a going concern and feel it only appropriate to flag these risks. \"It is hoped that these will be resolved over the months ahead but since a number of these risks are outside of the control of the trustees, they recognised that if this is not possible they will need to consider the further delay to the project, and in a worst-case scenario, whether the project remains viable.\" The Garden Bridge has been beset with problems. In September Mr Khan ordered a review into whether the public had so far been given value for money from the project, adding he believed there had not \"been the necessary standard of transparency and openness around the Garden Bridge\". That review, led by Dame Margaret Hodge, a former chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, has yet to report back but Mr Khan has already said that no more taxpayer money will be provided to fund the project. In October it emerged that former prime minister David Cameron had ignored the advice of civil servants over Garden Bridge funding, personally intervening to approve extra taxpayer money for the controversial project. The National Audit Office (NOA) said at the time that nearly \u00a323m of taxpayer money was at risk of being lost.", "question": "The trust behind a project to build a bridge @placeholder with trees and shrubs across the Thames in London has revealed it is \" unable to conclude it is a going concern \" .", "option_0": "built", "option_1": "clash", "option_2": "associated", "option_3": "covered", "option_4": "tasked", "label": 3}
{"article": "\"Your iron industry is dead, dead as mutton. Your coal industries, which depend greatly on the iron industries, are languishing. Your silk industry is dead, assassinated by the foreigner. Your woollen industry is in articulo mortis, gasping, struggling. Your cotton industry is seriously sick. Your shipbuilding industry, which held out longest, is come to a standstill.\" The Latin, the silk and the mutton are a dead giveaway. Not Trump, but Lord Randolph Churchill in 1884 denouncing Free Trade. The system he preferred - \"Fair Trade\" - is coming back into fashion. We have heard a lot about the revolt against the political elites, the backlash by those \"left behind\" by globalization; a lot about the movements and political personalities this has brought to the fore; a lot about the implications for immigration. But not so much about the economics of it all. It many signal a new rejection of one of the global elite's most cherished policies - free trade. This is the notion that the fewer economic barriers around the world, and the less countries protect their own goods and trade with special policies, the richer we all end up. The opposite is protectionism - making foreign goods more expensive by putting taxes on their import , tariffs, in order to make home-grown products cheaper by comparison. While few embrace the word protectionism, growing numbers of politicians are openly embracing the principle behind it. Donald Trump has said he would put a swingeing 45% tax on goods from China and 35% on many from Mexico. Many economists mock this as crazy stuff, but it is a sentiment that goes down well with many Americans. I remember well talking to a wide variety of people at \"the biggest little flea market in the world\" in Kentucky, including a man sadly selling Western-style cowboy belts made in China. Just about everyone I spoke to complained about \"the jobs going to Mexico and China\". Trump is not alone, and this is a sentiment not only of the right. Bernie Sanders has made it very clear he is opposed to NAFTA, the free trade bloc with Mexico and Canada, and the planned Asia Pacific agreement. Trans-Pacific Partnership: What is it and why does it matter? He has been saying it for a while. This is him in 2011: \"Let's be clear: one of the major reasons that the middle class in America is disappearing, poverty is increasing and the gap between the rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider, is due to our disastrous unfettered free trade policy.\" The fringe has come to the fore. That changes the mood of the mainstream too. The person still most likely to end up in the White House, Hillary Clinton, was once a fierce defender of the Asia deal. She now says: \"I do absorb new information. I do look at what's happening in the world. Take the trade deal. I did say, when I was secretary of state three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. \"It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards\u2026. I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say: 'this will help raise your wages'. And I concluded I could not.\" What the US does will set the tone for the rest of the world. And the enthusiasm for free trade is being increasingly questioned in the rest of the world. The \"Vote Leave\" campaign here advocates free trade, and says it will continue if we vote to exit the European Union. But opponents point out that, in at least a couple of possible futures, new tariffs would be imposed on us. One passionate Brexit campaigner, the entrepreneur and inventor Sir James Dyson, faces that prospect with equanimity. He told the Telegraph: \"If, as David Cameron suggested, they imposed a tariff of 10% on us, we will do the same in return. We buy more from Europe than they buy from us, so we would be the net beneficiary, and based on these numbers it would bring \u00a310bn into the UK annually.\" A debate that seemed all but settled with the repeal of the Corn Laws  in the UK could about to become one of the most central issues in politics. In Our Time: The Corn Laws It is worth remembering that argument split the Conservative Party between its economic liberal and nationalist wings. Again the left has its own concerns. Jeremy Corbyn may be campaigning with 75% commitment to remain in the EU, but he is against the Free Trade deal (TTIP) with the US. TTIP: The EU-US trade deal explained The EU itself is, formally, a great supporter of free trade, while there is a suspicion that on the sly countries like France give advantage to their own industries, whenever  they can get away with it. But Europe's fastest growing economy has announced this week a more open breach with the internationalist philosophy. The determinately populist ruling party in Poland, has just declared a \"Farewell to Neoliberalism\". The deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, declares the nation is too dependent on foreign money: \"We want the invisible hand of the market supported by the visible hand of the state\". The Hungarian Prime Minister has been following a similar path for some time. This reaction, in the US and Europe, is part of the aftershock of the 2008 economic crisis and the sense of frustration and powerlessness felt by many voters. But free trade is not just questioned in the West. China has recently imposed 46% tariffs on certain types of steel. While it is attempting to close down loss-making \"zombie industries\" the primacy of the party is all, and it will not allow unfettered international competition threaten social stability. And the Chinese are the main target of such measures by countries around the globe. Researchers believe free trade has been under attack for several years. The 2015 report from the Centre for Economic Policy Research's Global Trade Alert, says: \"the 'level playing field' has taken a battering this year \u2026 governments imposed 539 trade distortions in the first ten months of this year, of which the G20 were responsible for 443\". Another report from last year, by the EU, also finds backsliding, claiming the G20 is breaking its promises: \"(the) pledge to refrain from adopting new trade-restrictive measures - and to roll back those in place - has not been honoured.... What is more, trade restriction has shifted eastwards, with Russia, China, India and Indonesia among the main offenders\". This is a huge challenge to the rebalancing of the world economy which we cover with the dustsheet rubric \"globalisation\". National politicians have always put their own country's economic interests first. But for decades those in power have argued economics is not a zero-sum game, and what benefits one benefits all. While the game hasn't quite changed to \"beggar thy neighbour\" those who want to look after the left-behinds, or at least court their votes, may clamour for a contest where the richer nations reassert their self-perceived right to be top dog.", "question": "Which politician has captured the curve , summed up a growing mood , in a ferocious @placeholder ?", "option_0": "speech", "option_1": "battle", "option_2": "media", "option_3": "show", "option_4": "mood", "label": 0}
{"article": "This happened in the 1960s in Cessnock, a former mining town in the New South Wales Hunter Valley, but only now has this and other decades-old stories of sexual violence and degradation been heard, catalogued and, crucially for many victims, believed. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse is an unprecedented investigation into an epidemic of depravity across Australia. The far-reaching inquiry began in 2013 and has heard from thousands of survivors of paedophiles who worked, or volunteered, in sporting clubs, schools, churches, charities, childcare centres and the military. It has the power to look at any private, public or non-government body that is, or was, involved with children. The Commission's task is to make recommendations on how to improve laws, policies and practices to protect the young. To date, it has held more than 6,000 private sessions, along with several high-profile public hearings. Paul Gray told investigators that between the ages of 10 and 14, he was sexually assaulted by Father Peter Rushton in Cessnock every one or two weeks. Sometimes, his attacker had an accomplice. \"I was chased by two men to the edge of the cliff and I hid in the bushes. \"After a while they dragged me from the bushes and I was raped by the two men, and while I was being raped I could hear another boy screaming,\" said Mr Gray, fighting back tears as he recounted memories that have burned inside him for half a century. Too ill to travel from the Vatican to Sydney to give evidence, Australia's most prominent churchman, Cardinal George Pell, was questioned via video link by the Royal Commission over what he knew about alleged abuse and cover-ups within the Catholic Church. For four days earlier this year, the senior Vatican official was quizzed, denying any personal wrongdoing but conceding the organisation had made grave errors. \"I am not here to defend the indefensible,\" said Cardinal Pell. \"The Church has made enormous mistakes, is working to remedy those, but the Church has in many places - certainly in Australia - mucked things up.\" When he was 13, John Ellis, a former altar boy, was molested by an Australian monk who was also implicated in a suspected paedophile ring at a former Catholic boarding school in the Scottish Highlands. Now a solicitor, Mr Ellis works with other victims, and we meet at a public hearing held by the commission on the 17th floor of Governor Macquarie Tower that stands over central Sydney. Presiding over the session is the chief royal commissioner, Justice Peter McClellan, a judge of appeal in New South Wales. He is one of six commissioners; two women and four men, and they include a former Queensland police chief, a consultant child psychiatrist and a retired federal politician. They have fanned out across Australia to document a nation's shame. \"The most important thing for people in being invited to give their own stories and having their stories valued is that somebody cares,\" Mr Ellis told the BBC news website. \"For many, many years people have been silenced, people have been fearful of what reaction they will get if they were to tell their truth. The overwhelming emotion people have when they have had that opportunity is empowerment.\" When it hands down its final report at the end of 2017, this painstaking inquiry will have lasted for almost five years.  Already, more than 1,700 cases have been referred to the authorities, including the police. More prosecutions will almost certainly follow, but many victims will never savour justice. Dr Wayne Chamley, from Broken Rites, a group that gives a voice to the abused, said decades of brutality had left a terrible legacy. \"When you look at the rate of suicide for men who had these experiences and compared it with age-matched data from the coroners' courts, their risk factor is 20 to 40 times higher for suicide,\" he explained to the BBC. \"There are townships where there have been waves of suicide with hundreds of men. [In] Ballarat [in Victoria state], at least 50 or 60 suicides across just three classes in the primary school - just three classes of boys who became men. Bang. Devastating.\" Gerard McDonald, 52, is a survivor of abuse, and one of thousands of people who have told their stories to the commission. His attacker, a Catholic priest, has spent 14 years in prison for attacking 35 boys. \"After every other altar boy practice in 1975, before dropping me home Father (Vincent) Ryan would sexually abuse me. All I could do was think about running to my mate's place and getting the biggest two knives he had and killing him,\" he said. While this harrowing process is undoubtedly cathartic for Australia - and it's inevitable that legislation and procedures will eventually change to make children safer - campaigners insist many youngsters today still remain at risk from predators in institutions, while paedophiles stalking the internet continue to groom the vulnerable.", "question": "In Australia , a boy of 10 is raped by an Anglican clergyman , who cuts his victim with a small knife and smears @placeholder over his back in a twisted ritual to symbolise the suffering of Christ .", "option_0": "crafts", "option_1": "leans", "option_2": "powers", "option_3": "blood", "option_4": "criticism", "label": 3}

A further 17% said their workload \"significantly negatively impacts\" on the quality of care they can provide. Three-fifths (60%) of doctors in Scotland who took part in the 2015 national survey described their workload as being \"generally manageable\" but \"too heavy at times\". Only 8% thought having 10 minutes for each consultation was sufficient time, with 63% wanting longer consultations for certain groups of patients - such as those with long-term conditions - and 30% saying there should be more time available for all patients. A total of 1,844 doctors in Scotland took part in the research, with the BMA saying this represented 37% of all GPs in the country. When asked what would help them deliver the \"essential components of general practice\", 75% wanted longer consultation times, 74% believe there should be more GPs and 69% responded that increased core funding for practices would make a difference. Dr Colette Maule, co-negotiator of the BMA's Scottish GP committee, said: \"This survey reflects the immense pressure that GPs working across Scotland are feeling just now. \"The rising workload is simply unsustainable and something has to change otherwise general practice will break. \"Giving us more time with patients, expanding the GP workforce and supporting the practice-based primary care team will help to ensure the quality of care our patients receive remains of a high standard. \"In addition, providing stable funding arrangements to meet the rising costs of providing increasingly complex care in the community will alleviate some of the helplessness that GPs are clearly feeling just now. \"Politicians need to stop fixating on how they can demand more from general practice and instead focus on what they can do to support GPs to provide the quality of care that our patients deserve within the constraints that exist.\" Health Secretary Shona Robison said: \"The recently-agreed new GP contract in Scotland will give general practice financial stability, reducing the bureaucratic burden and freeing up GPs to spend more time with patients. \"Individual GP practices determine their appointment and consultation arrangements. \"The length of a consultation will vary depending on the clinical needs of the individual patient and is a matter of professional judgement for the GP.\" Ms Robison added: \"The Scottish government is determined to continue supporting and sustaining Scottish general practice.

{"article": "In some cases, ISPs are advertising services as fibre that rely on slower copper wires for the final link to a customer's home. The probe has been prompted by consumer complaints and calls from MP Matt Warman to investigate. Mr Warman said ISPs were misleading customers by giving them copper when they expected fibre. In a statement, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it was acting because of \"evolving concerns\" about the way fibre broadband services were advertised, and recent changes to government policy, which meant far more people would potentially have access to such services. Policy papers spelling out the government's view made clear that fibre should be used only to describe services that rely on the faster cables from end to end, it said. The ASA said it would consider whether ISPs should be able to continue using \"fibre broadband\" to describe both full and part-fibre services. \"We will be considering whether the use of that term is likely to cause people to be materially misled,\" it said. The ASA did not say when it would complete its work but said it would provide an update by the summer. James Blessing, chair of the council at the UK's Internet Service Providers Association said it had been \"working with the ASA on their wider review into broadband advertising to ensure that adverts are understood by consumers and help them make informed choices about the services, products and technologies that best suit their needs.\" He said ISPA \"looked forward\" to helping the ASA's review of what the word \"fibre\" means in adverts. Andrew Ferguson, co-founder of the ThinkBroadband website, said \"clarity\" on advertising would be welcome. \"Then we can avoid adverts that promote fibre optic broadband but clearly show a coax cable with a metal core,\" he said.

The Conference bent over backwards to help them. \"I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking. \"It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves. \"You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.\" The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June. The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to \u00a3148,000. That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June. But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted. The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010. They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up. By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane. 26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season 29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for \u00a31 and clear their \u00a3220,000 debts 22 May -  Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too 2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice 3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner 5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote 6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June 10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference And former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary. When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately \u00a3225,000. They still owe over \u00a370,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). An offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for \u00a31 and take over the running at Edgar Street. But, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option. Keyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover. The downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates.

{"article": "Small businesses are the clear winners from the Budget with big businesses picking up the bill - and then some. The biggest beef for small businesses are rates, which far exceed the amount they pay in corporation tax, and there were hopes they would be reduced. Mr Osborne has obliged, announcing 630,000 small businesses will pay no business rates at all from next year. He claims the reduction will save \u00c2\u00a37bn per year for businesses. The bill for that will fall to big corporations. Big firms face a crackdown on practices which reduce taxable profits, including offsetting debt interest against profits and using losses in one year to offset profits in another. The government says this combination of measures will raise \u00c2\u00a39bn. Yet in the past, measures to crack down on tax avoidance have had mixed success and the chancellor is relying heavily on it to fund his small business initiatives.

{"article": "First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, and their Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat counterparts all voiced their support for a law change. Their calls come ahead of a major gay rights rally in Belfast on Saturday. Northern Ireland is the only part of the British Isles where same-sex marriage is outlawed. The issue has long been a divisive one, with attempts to introduce it having been blocked by the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The party rejects claims that it is homophobic, and has said it is protecting the \"traditional\" definition of marriage. The matter has become a sticking point in talks between the DUP and Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in aimed at restoring power-sharing at Stormont. Earlier this week, celebrities, including actor Liam Neeson and TV presenter Graham Norton, added their backing to the same-sex marriage campaign. A bill to allow same-sex marriages in Scotland was overwhelmingly approved by the region's parliament in 2014, and the heads of its five main parties have now said the same measure should be introduced in Northern Ireland. Ms Sturgeon said she was proud to have supported same-sex marriage in Scotland and was \"thrilled to see the positive reaction\" to it. \"The debate over equal marriage in Scotland did more than just simply allow people to marry,\" she said. \"It also helped to challenge negative attitudes that still exist today in our society towards LGBTI people and show, quite simply, that same-sex couples are just as valued as opposite sex couples.\" Ms Davidson said she was \"optimistic this is a battle that can be won\". \"Equal marriage isn't about one religion or country or community - it's much simpler than that,\" the Scottish Tory leader said. \"At its heart, equal marriage is about the people of Northern Ireland being afforded the same rights as everybody else. \"Change is coming. And it's a change for the better.\" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said that the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Scotland, England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland has been \"liberating and encouraging\". The debate on the matter in Northern Ireland should be \"conducted courteously\", Ms Dugdale said, adding: \"It's time for LGBT people across the whole of the UK to enjoy the right to marry who they want.\" Patrick Harvie, the co-convener of the Scottish Green Party, said gay rights campaigners would not \"accept that the prejudice of the DUP will never be overcome\". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the \"world has not collapsed\" since gay marriages first took place in Scotland.

The next day the singer phoned in to donate the money, Osman tweeted. Family and friends were touched \"beyond words\" by the \"outpouring of love\" from Michael's fans, his publicist said. Other stories of the star's benevolence, including a \u00a350,000 Sport Relief donation, have emerged on social media. In a string of tweets celebrating the singer's music and humour, comedian and author David Walliams tweeted that the star had supported his 2006 cross-Channel swim to the tune of \u00a350,000. Osman tweeted in the hours following news that Michael had been found dead at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, on Christmas Day, aged 53.

What more can I say other than 'Thank you George'.\" At the time, in 2008, Mr Davies had told the Manchester Evening News: \"Thank you is not enough. It restores your faith in humankind. \"All the bad news you read about and then something like this happens.\" Michael's donations ranged in scope from major charities and appeals to individual acts of kindness. The proceeds from sales of Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me, his 1991 live duet with Sir Elton John, were donated to HIV and children's charities, including the Terence Higgins Trust. It tweeted: \"Thank you to George Michael for all he did for the LGBT community and to educate about HIV. RIP George.\" Michael's family and close friends thanked fans for their \"many, many, kind words\", his publicist said in a statement. \"There can be no more fitting tribute\", the statement said. \"We thank those who, rightly, have chosen to celebrate his life and legacy.\" Wham! royalties from Last Christmas went to Ethiopian famine relief efforts, while the founder of the children's helpline charity Childline, Dame Esther Rantzen, said Michael had donated royalties from the song Jesus to a Child to the cause. \"He really wanted to keep his help secret, it was an intensely personal gift,\" Dame Esther told BBC News. \"It meant we could answer more children.\" She said Michael, who she estimated had donated around \u00a32m to Childline over the years, \"completely understood\" the importance of helping children. \"Maybe he felt their pain or understood from a personal perspective,\" she said. Children's charities were also at the fore when he donated each year to Capital Radio's appeal. Former presenter Mick Brown tweeted: \"Every Easter at Capital when I was on air with Chris Tarrant for help a London child, George would call in at 3.30pm with a \u00a3100,000 donation.\" He also suffered the loss of his mother to cancer in 1997 and in 2006 played a special, free concert at the Roundhouse in Camden, north London, for NHS nurses to thank them for their care. And he gave his time to Macmillan Cancer Support as one of their ambassadors. Alongside major charities, individuals on Twitter shared their accounts of his kindness. Journalist Sali Hughes said: \"I wrote in a piece ages ago about a celeb I'd worked with tipping a barmaid \u00a35k because she was a student nurse in debt.

{"article": "Jasurbek Ibragimov was badly beaten, allegedly by a group of students who bullied him. He died in hospital a month later. His death could have gone unnoticed. However, it has turned out to be a major shake-up for the repressive system in Uzbekistan. Shortly before Jasurbek's death, his mother wrote a letter to the president asking for justice. That letter went viral on social media and Facebook and Telegram groups copied and shared the text. Those who beat Jasurbek to death, Nilufar Aliyeva wrote, bragged that they could get away with it since their parents who were lawyers could buy the police. It was this feeling of impunity that made people particularly furious about this case. Heated discussions online resulted in a gathering in the capital Tashkent where people signed a petition, demanding to those responsible for Jasurbek's death be punished. About 600 people signed the petition. But don't be misled by that figure. For Uzbekistan, this kind of gathering is extremely rare. The last time a crowd tried to voice their demands, the military opened fire at them. That was in Andijan in 2005. Hundreds were killed. Uzbekistan is regarded as one of the most repressive states in the world. Its human rights record is abysmal and any uncontrolled civil initiative is treated as a potential threat for the regime. In the case of Jasurbek's death, many citizens seem to realise that they could pressurise government offices by speaking up. And it worked. A criminal case was finally opened shortly after Nilufar Aliyeva wrote her letter to the president. The public outcry forced the law enforcement agencies to share information about the investigation with the public. Local media that usually remain silent reprinted the letter of Jasurbek's mother. The head of the medical college where Jasurbek studied was sacked. But what makes this case unusual is that the government is not trying to suppress the initiative. On the contrary, they tried to assist the petitioners when they gathered to sign the document. \"It was very nice to see law enforcement officers who actually tried to help us,\" Mariya Legler, one of the co-ordinators who gathered signatures, said. \"They helped to co-ordinate and manage the crowd to ensure that the gathering was not messy and people wouldn't push each other. They answered the questions people raised.\" In a repressive state like Uzbekistan people normally don't dare to ask police questions. Usually it's the opposite. So far one of the suspected attackers has been arrested and charged with aggravated battery that led to the death of the victim. Police are questioning witnesses to try to identify other individuals involved in the crime. The investigation is continuing. Such an initiative is unlikely to have been welcomed under the rule of the late Islam Karimov who died last September. New President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has introduced a number of changes suggesting a certain degree of liberalisation. He improved relations with neighbouring states that were extremely tense under Karimov. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development resumed its operations that were halted a decade ago. Several long-held political prisoners were released and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights visited the country for the first time. Some major reforms like floating the currency and introducing visa free regime were held up. The news agency Reuters reported, citing sources, that that was due to opposition from security service chief Rustam Inoyatov. It is not clear whether Mr Mirziyoyev will continue with his reforms once the alleged infighting is over or whether he will turn to authoritarianism after he consolidates power in his hands. But the case of Jasurbek's death illustrates how reforms can encourage a grassroots movement. Like Islam Karimov, Mr Mirziyoyev may see it as a threat to his power.

Keith Lamont Scott's family dispute police allegations he was armed and want video recording to be released. Excessive police force used against black men has been the subject of protests for two years across the US. On Tuesday, Mr Scott was killed in Charlotte after police say he refused to drop a gun he was carrying. His family say he was unarmed and holding a book. Police have released a video of the shooting to the family, but have refused to make it public. The family's lawyer, Justin Bamberg, said no gun was visible in the video and Mr Scott appeared to be \"acting calm\". \"You do see something in his hand, but it's impossible to make out from the video what it is.\" Police chief Kerr Putney said the video proved the shooting was justified, telling Fox news: \"The officer perceived his failure to comply with commands, failure to drop the weapon and facing the officers as an imminent threat.\" On Thursday, demonstrators protesting against Mr Scott's death defied a curfew put into force by the city's mayor on Thursday - running from midnight to 06:00. According to Cpt Mike Campagna, officers did not enforce the curfew as protests were largely peaceful, with some on the street singing gospel songs. However Charlotte police reported two officers were injured. Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed on the streets to protect the city against further violence and property damage. It followed Wednesday's protest during which protesters smashed windows of hotels and restaurants, set fires, and attacked reporters. Peaceful demonstrations took place in the aftermath of last week's shooting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. On Thursday, officer Betty Shelby was charged with manslaughter for shooting an unarmed man. Prosecutors said her decision to shoot Terence Crutcher was \"unreasonable\". Video of the incident shows Mr Crutcher with his hands up, leaning against the car. Officer Shelby said Mr Crutcher had not followed her commands and she had opened fire when he began to reach into his car window. As well as being shot, Mr Crutcher was also struck with a stun gun by another officer. Ms Shelby's lawyer, Scott Wood, has said she believed Mr Crutcher was under the influence of the synthetic drug PCP. A vial of the drug was found in the car. His family have disputed Ms Shelby's claim, arguing that his window was closed at the time of the incident. Police have said no gun was found on Mr Crutcher or inside his vehicle. The US justice department has also opened a separate investigation to see if Mr Crutcher's civil rights were violated. If convicted, Ms Shelby faces a minimum of four years in prison. After the charge, a small group of demonstrators gathered to demand a harsher sentence. Just four days before the first presidential debate, Republican Donald Trump said the violence from the Charlotte protests was largely due to drugs. \"If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,\" he said. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine said the list of black men fatally shot by police had \"grown too long\" and the country needed to confront the issue of racial tensions.

{"article": "It is a well-thumbed copy of Catch 22, Joseph Heller's classic satirical novel on the absurdities of war; not an inappropriate choice for somebody who's spent her entire life amid one of the Middle East's most intractable conflicts. But Rawan's life is about to take a different direction. Currently a student at Gaza's Islamic University, she has just won a scholarship to Oxford University to study linguistics and Italian. She is looking forward to moving from the minarets of Gaza to the city of \"dreaming spires\". \"I'm very excited. I can't wait,\" she smiles. \"It's going to be different but it's going to be fun.\" Few have made such a journey. But what is even more unusual is that all the other students at Oxford's Jesus College will pay some of the cost of Rawan's studies. As part of the recently established Jesus College Junior Members Scholarship most of the other students have each agreed to pay \u00c2\u00a33.90 ($5.90) per term towards Rawan's fees. The scholarship was set up by Oxford graduate Emily Dreyfus after she realised that few Gazans had ever had the chance to study at one of Britain's most prestigious universities. She says most other students at Jesus were happy to contribute. \"They voted for this from the outset. They recognise that this is a very small contribution to make which has a disproportionately positive benefit.\" The student contributions will raise around \u00c2\u00a36,300 a year towards Rawan's living costs. This is only a fraction of the estimated \u00c2\u00a330,000 annual costs needed to complete the four-year course. But the university has agreed to waive around 60% of the tuition fees. The rest of the costs are being paid for by three charities: The Hani Qaddumi Scholarship Foundation, the AM Qattan Foundation and the Hoping Foundation which supports Palestinian refugees around the world. Rawan still had to apply for and win the place against fierce competition, but she knows the other students at Jesus have given her a rare opportunity. \"I really appreciate that Emily believed in people here and she gave somebody like me a life changing chance,\" she says. Rawan has only once before left the tiny Palestinian territory, when she went on a study trip to the United States. Israel's blockade of Gaza and the ongoing conflict with Hamas which governs here make it difficult for Palestinians to leave through Israel. In the past, Israel has refused permission for Palestinian students to leave Gaza in order to carry out studies abroad. It is likely Rawan will leave Gaza through Egypt in order to travel to Oxford. She is currently completing a degree in English literature studying, among other books, George Orwell's Animal Farm and William Golding's Lord of the Flies. She says her favourite book is Mornings In Jenin by the Palestinian American writer Susan AbulHawa. The novel follows the story of three generations of a Palestinian family who became refugees after the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. Rawan is also a fan of JK Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books. \"Her style of writing is very subtle. There are little things in her stories that grab your attention.\" Education is highly valued in Gaza. There are no fewer than seven universities in the territory for a population of 1.7 million people. But Rawan is expecting a different study experience at Oxford. \"The education system is completely different. I'm going to have my own tutors not like in Gaza where I am among hundreds of students who have the same teacher.\" She will also have to get used to mixed education. At the Islamic University, where she studies now, men and women are taught separately. \"I don't think it's going to be a problem. The culture there is obviously very different but I'm open to that.\" Rawan also accepts that she is going to miss home. \"Of course I will be homesick. But I have to go through that and get used to it because I have something more important to achieve.\" Emily Dreyfus expects the young Palestinian will be given a warm welcome. \"I'm confident that she's going to have a wonderful time and I know that there are a lot of people at the college eager to meet her and to welcome her to their community.\" And Rawan is looking forward to telling people about a different side of life in Gaza. \"Most people think it's like a war zone here and that everyone here is really depressed and involved in politics,\" she says. \"But it's not always about war. It's also about families, friends and love. It's not only about the conflict with Israel.\" And despite the chance to broaden her horizons, she is adamant that once she has finished her four years in Oxford, she will return to Gaza. \"I still haven't thought about what I'll do after university but I'll definitely come back here. Although it may seem difficult to live here, it's still interesting and adventurous at times,\" she says with a wry smile. \"There is ugliness in Gaza but you can't leave it and turn your back on it.\"", "question": "Rawan Yaghi is a bookish 19 year old who , appropriately for a student of literature , @placeholder to meet me in Gaza with a text tucked under her arm .", "option_0": "arrives", "option_1": "arranged", "option_2": "dedicated", "option_3": "promising", "option_4": "writes", "label": 0}

{"article": "But she told the BBC from the hospital where her daughter is receiving treatment that she is thankful for the support the family has received worldwide. \"I am very grateful to all the people who have supported us through this ordeal,\" she said. Her daughter was attacked and repeatedly raped by six men in June as she returned from her grandfather's funeral in Tingolo village in Busia County, western Kenya. Her unconscious body was thrown into a pit latrine and she is now in a wheelchair. Her case caused an uproar after Kenya's influential Daily Nation newspaper reported that the police in Busia had asked three of the suspects she identified as her rapists to cut grass as punishment and had chosen not to prosecute them. In a BBC interview on Thursday, Police Inspector General David Kimaiyo said an investigation into the girl's allegation had been concluded, but still no decision had been taken on whether it was a rape case. He said he was unaware that her alleged attackers were ordered to cut grass and that the case was reported to police only two months after \"the incident\". But several hundred activists in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, carrying placards, waving underwear and beating drums marched to the police headquarters, where the inspector general's office is located, and handed over a petition calling for the arrest of the suspects and the officers who allegedly failed to prosecute them. The petition, which was started online, was signed by more than 1,200,000 people from around the world. Saida Ali, executive director of the Coalition on Violence Against Women (COVAW) rights group, was among the protesters who handed the petition to police on Thursday. \"The response was polite, they promised to take action, so we will wait to see that action,\" she said. The girl, who is called Liz to protect her identity, is being cared for at the Gynocare Centre in Eldoret, 156km (97 miles) from Busia. Her mother is staying with her at the hospital. I briefly saw Liz, who answered my greeting in Swahili, the main language in Kenya, but the rest of the time she just stared, showing no emotion. We were told that this is an improvement and that last week she had refused to look any of her visitors in the eye. The Nation Media Group, a Kenya-based media house which first reported the story, has paid the medical bills for Liz amounting to more than $7,000 (\u00c2\u00a34,300). Their reporter named her Liz and that is how the world now knows her. Her mother said that since the online campaign began some people had even set up an education fund for Liz. But her medical condition is still of concern. She suffered fistula because of the rape - a condition where she lost control of the flow of urine and stool. The programme manager at the hospital, Jared Momanyi, said she had undergone surgery to correct the fistula. \"She was also traumatised but has been receiving counselling and she is improving,\" he added. She also injured her spine when she was thrown down the pit latrine and has been unable to walk for some time. Since the matter went public, and viral, the mother says some family members of the suspects have been threatening her. \"They said that if their sons are arrested I'll see fire,\" she said. Earlier her husband had to endure insults from a father of one suspect, who had initially offered to help the family, and then rescinded his decision. \"I want the suspects to be arrested and justice to be done. Up to now no-one has been arrested. I hear some have gone into hiding,\" Liz's mother said. The inspector general of police confirmed that the suspects could not be traced, adding that they had fled into Uganda. Busia - where the incident took place - is near the Kenya-Uganda border. The Director of Public Prosecution, Keriako Tobiko, has ordered their arrests but none has been made so far. However, Mr Tobiko confirmed to the BBC that he had received the investigations file from the police and was going through it. \"I will press charges once I find sufficient evidence,\" he said. The Sexual Offences Act of 2006 spells out tough punitive measures against people convicted of various sexual crimes. The Act empowers the court to issue a sentence of not less than 15 years for a conviction of gang rape, but the court may extend the sentence to imprisonment for life. The police in June released a report showing that reported cases of rape had increased to 383 between January and May this year, from 332 for the same period last year. Police stations in Kenya are expected to have a gender desk where such cases are reported. But Liz's mother rarely smiled during her interview - she sounded like she had lost faith in the authorities.", "question": "The mother of the 16 - year - old Kenyan girl who says she was raped by six men and @placeholder in a 22 - ft ( 6.7 m ) deep latrine looked numb with worry .", "option_0": "dumped", "option_1": "found", "option_2": "locked", "option_3": "raped", "option_4": "hid", "label": 0}

{"article": "But who will be crowned champions and who will take the breath away? Are defending champions New Zealand overwhelming favourites? Will hosts England survive the so-called 'group of death'? Former internationals from the home nations - Jeremy Guscott and Paul Grayson (England), Jonathan Davies and Robert Jones (Wales), Gavin Hastings and Mike Blair (Scotland), plus Stephen Ferris and Denis Hickie (Ireland) - are joined by southern hemisphere stars such as ex-All Black Andrew Mehrtens and Bobby Skinstad (South Africa) to tackle the big questions. Jeremy Guscott: \"Host nations invariably do well. Statistically they've always made the knockout stages and three times they've won it, albeit New Zealand have done it twice. South Africa in 1995 were the other home winners. On that basis alone, England should do well.\" Jonathan Davies: \"All the pundits have favoured Australia and England to get out of Pool A, but on their day Wales can beat anyone. Yes, we are third favourites but I still think Wales can shock one of those two and hopefully get through the group.\" Gavin Hastings: \"Realistically, getting out of the pool would be a good tournament. Scotland are a bit of an unknown quantity but they seem fit and strong and have a core of good players. South Africa will find it tough to play against Scotland, and we are capable of beating Samoa to get out of the group. I hope we play England in the quarter-finals at Twickenham!\" Stephen Ferris: \"Ireland can definitely get to a semi-final, which would be an achievement in itself. But we need to up the physicality from our recent games.\" Robert Jones: \"Wales are still a threat despite the injuries. Liam Williams needs match practice but he is probably a more creative attacking threat than Leigh Halfpenny, and Dan Biggar is almost as good a kicker and has grown into a fantastic player. As long as we stay injury free now to the end of the pool stage, I think we still have a chance.\" Mike Blair: \"Scotland will make the quarter-finals but they will need to play well to get there as it's not just about South Africa and Samoa in Pool B. Japan and USA will be very competitive too.\" Andrew Mehrtens: \"Most players around the world would say they would like to beat the All Blacks more than any other team, so the All Blacks have that pressure and weight of history. Every team lifts themselves when they play them, because it is the biggest game of their lives.\" Bobby Skinstad: \"The Springboks are probably slightly under-cooked, with half a dozen players coming back from injury. They are possibly not quite at their best yet, but I think that helps them. The selection has remained consistent and they have leaders with huge character.\" Denis Hickie: \"Momentum is key. Ireland have to beat Canada well in their first game and build into it because everyone thinks it will come down to the France game. Ireland have won two and drawn two of their last four against them, so there is confidence based on what has happened in the Six Nations. The flip side is Ireland have lost all three games against France at World Cups.\" Paul Grayson: \"With a bit of luck, England can win it.\" JG: \"Yes. They won't be fully tested until the quarter-finals or potentially the semis, if they make it that far, so they will be vulnerable when they face their first real test.\" JD: \"The winner of Pool A will go to the final. Australia are looking very good and England will have home advantage if they go through. But for me it's still New Zealand.\" AM: \"Australia are on the rise. They beat the All Blacks pretty comprehensively in Sydney and have a good team culture. The coach Michael Cheika is earthy and passionate; he is a hard taskmaster but the players seem to love him. They are coming in with some real momentum and have some stars in their backline.  If they get enough ball, they can go very well.\" MB: \"Yes. I believe that on their day England and South Africa could beat them, but the All Blacks are the strong favourites.\" SF: \"If you gave me money to put a bet on, I would put it on New Zealand. But I think the five or six usual suspects all have a genuine chance at winning the tournament and I would include England in that, even though I think it could go the other way with them perhaps not even making it out of their group. \"I really like South Africa's chances - the pack is so strong and rugby nowadays is all about the three Ps - pace, power, physicality.\" JG: \"Argentina have the potential to surprise France or Ireland in the quarter-finals - just ask South Africa, who the Pumas beat in the Rugby Championship.\" JD: \"Scotland will be the surprise package in their group and will go through. France will surprise Ireland.\" GH: \"Ireland, within themselves, will feel they are good enough to win this World Cup, and anything less than that, amongst the team, will be a failure. Not having got to a semi-final before doesn't make any difference to this current side. I think Ireland are capable of doing it.\" MB: \"It won't be a surprise as such but I think Ireland will have a strong tournament and will push the big guns along the way. It's crucial for them that they top their group, though, to avoid New Zealand in the quarter-finals.\" SF: \"Many people are writing Ireland off after their recent couple of lacklustre performances but I expect us to surprise a few people and to get back to the kind of form we have produced in the last two Six Nations and reach the semi-finals.\" JD: \"Unfortunately for Wales, I think it's going to be Israel Folau. The Australia full-back is a class act. He is an amazing player who can cause damage against anyone. Depending on how far Australia go, he could be the player of the tournament.\" Media playback is not supported on this device PG: \"When you have been the best in the world, you get to almost write your own scripts, and Dan Carter is the sort of guy who if New Zealand go well, he can elevate himself to the point where he could be sensational.\" BS: \"Israel Folau is probably the number one convert from rugby league with the athleticism he brings. He is just devastating on the counter-attack.\" AM:  \"All Blacks scrum-half Aaron Smith. The speed of his pass dictates the tempo of New Zealand's game and gives Dan Carter the time and space to operate. Even if the defence has numbers, it means they are always on the back foot.\" MB: \"New Zealand's Nehe Milner-Skudder is incredible. His footwork and offloads are ridiculous. England wing Jonny May is looking electric too and, given space, he will do damage.\" JG: \"Australia full-back Israel Folau, New Zealand full-back Ben Smith and England fly-half George Ford and outside centre Jonathan Joseph.\" SF: \"I am convinced that my former Ulster team-mate Iain Henderson is going to be one of the real stars of the tournament. South Africa's Duane Vermeulen will have a tremendous tournament and you can't expect anything other than Richie McCaw to round off a magnificent career by producing his usual brilliance for New Zealand and probably leading them to another World Cup triumph.\" JG: \"Home advantage gives England a big edge. In addition, if Australia, Wales and England all beat each other, they will know what result they have to achieve in their last match against Uruguay.\" JD: \"If you're looking at it as a betting man, Australia and England are the two to get out of Pool A. Despite the setbacks with injuries, I still think Wales can shock one of those two and hopefully get through the group.\" MB: \"Yes. With home advantage, a strong squad and a couple of injuries to the Welsh squad, I think they will advance.\" SF: \"That's a tough one and I can see it going either way for England. But with the massive weight of expectation that they must shoulder and the pressure their media will put on them, I will plump for Australia and Wales, despite their injury blows, to get out of that group. But conversely, I won't be shocked if England make it all the way to the final.\" GH: \"I would much rather be an England player at this World Cup than any other.

{"article": "The Welsh Government-sponsored review recommends stripping the body of most of its responsibilities and is strongly critical of management and governance. Chairman Prof Damian Walford Davies told BBC Wales the review's conclusions had stunned staff at Literature Wales. The review panel said it would be premature to comment with the recommendations still being considered. Literature Wales was created in 2011 to promote and develop reading and writing and had an income of about \u00c2\u00a31.2m last year. Prof Davies said: \"When the report was published we were dismayed, we were shocked, we were outraged by the dud that this report is. By its inaccuracies, by its under-par research into the field.\" Conclusions of the review, written by Prof Medwin Hughes, have also been criticised by the Arts Council of Wales, which funds the Cardiff-based Literature Wales. When the report was published last month, the Economy Secretary Ken Skates said he was \"minded\" to accept its recommendations. But Prof Davies said Mr Skates had since invited Literature Wales to submit a response to the review's conclusions. \"We met with the cabinet secretary [Ken Skates] and said that we needed a right of reply,\" he said. \"We needed not only the opportunity to put our case forward, but to correct the misrepresentations, the absences and the inaccuracies of the report. \"The cabinet secretary invited us to submit a full dossier of those concerns and those corrections. We have done so. That document runs to something like 5,000 words. \"That contains not only those corrections, not only counter-arguments, but documentary proof and analysis. That is a crack piece of work that blows this report out of the water.\" Among its conclusions, the review said the board of Literature Wales lacked experience and governance skills. The review recommends that Welsh Government: Mr Skates, who is considering the review's findings, declined to be interviewed. Prof Davies said the evidence it had recently submitted to Mr Skates provided \"context\" that would correct a lack of evidence for its conclusions. \"It is my fervent belief that those wider contexts make this report's recommendations seem what they are. Un-evidenced and un-thought through. Two years, and what do we have, this dud? \"It's simply unacceptable for the people of Wales. This report cost money.

{"article": "Robbie Keane poked in his 60th international goal in the 21st minute after a bright start from the hosts. But Johan Elmander headed a brilliant equaliser 12 minutes later as the Swedes began to take control. And with Zlatan Ibrahimovic dictating play, veteran Anders Svensson stroked in the winner on 57 minutes. The result means the Republic need to win in Austria on Tuesday and away to Germany next month to maintain any faint hopes of qualification, with a further home game against Kazakhstan to follow. Friday's result will inevitably lead to further criticism of Republic manager Giovanni Trapattoni and increase the prospects of him losing his job at the end of the current qualifying campaign. The match kicked off with both sides knowing defeat would leave them with an uphill struggle to clinch a play-off place behind runaway group leaders Germany. The Republic looked the more lively and purposeful outfit in the early stages, with Sweden centre-back Martin Olsson having to make a brave block to deny a goalbound Shane Long shot in the second minute. 10 September: Austria (a) 11 October: Germany (a) 15 October: Kazakhstan (h) The Swedish defence appeared vulnerable under the high ball with Glenn Whelan firing straight at keeper Andreas Isaksson in the eighth minute and Jonathan Walters then off target after a crunching challenge from John O'Shea on dangerman Ibrahimovic. At the other end, Marc Wilson made up for misjudging the flight of a deep cross as he reacted brilliantly to block an angled Ibrahimovic shot in the 16th minute. However, the Republic were continuing to look the busier and gave the visitors a scare on 20 minutes as an attempted cross from James McClean bounced on Isaksson's crossbar. The home team's enterprise was rewarded within a minute as Keane's chased down a weak Mikael Lustig back header and scrambled home after his initial poked shot hit the post. But that was as good as it got for the Irish as they quickly surrendered the initiative. Elmander had a chance to level within two minutes but scuffed his shot into David Forde's arms after hesitation in the Irish defence. Full qualifying tables On the half-hour, the unmarked Sebastian Larsson missed a glorious chance to level as he somehow headed wide from six yards after a beautifully weighted cross from Ibrahimovic. But the equaliser did come three minutes later as Lustig's brilliant right-wing cross was glanced home by Elmander after the Norwich striker got in ahead of Richard Dunne. McClean tested Isaksson six minutes into the second half but the Swedes, with Ibrahimovic controlling the game, were looking the more threatening. Forde had to race from his line on 55 minutes to dive at Larsson's feet after Ibrahimovic split the Irish defence with another superb pass. But Forde's efforts were to count for little when, seconds later, Ibrahimovic passed for 37-year-old Svensson to run through and fire past the keeper on the night he won his national-record equalling 143rd cap. In the closing stages, their was little shape to the Republic team, with recent Everton signing James McCarthy struggling to make any impression on the contest.

{"article": "There are those who will argue to kingdom come that the Six Nations is fine as it is, that it has its own identity and doesn't need to go down the road of being tricked up. What next? Kiss-cams. Mexican waves. Pitch-side microphone-wielding fun police ordering everybody to 'MAKE SOME NOISE!' Too late, alas. Too late. Those who are against bonus points for extra scores see it is a gimmick that will do nothing to enhance a tournament that doesn't need a whole lot of enhancing in the first place. Apply a retrospective bonus-point system and would it have changed the finishing order in 2016? No. How about 2015, 2014? No, no. Are there not enough tries in the Six Nations already? Not as many as its southern hemisphere counterpart, the Rugby Championship, but enough to satisfy the vast crowds who always turn up to watch it? The average try count per match in the 2016 Six Nations was 4.73. In the Rugby Championship it was 5.83. The season before it was 4.13 in the north and 5.5 in the south. The season before that, 4.07 in the Six Nations and 4.17 in the Rugby Championship. It's not as big a gulf as people might think. In any event, Six Nations rugby is not Rugby Championship rugby. It has its own heartbeat. Oftentimes, it's rugby in the trenches. Full Metal Jacket stuff. It's not as easy on the eye as the New Zealands and the Australias, but it works. And fans adore it. In the southern hemisphere's four-nation tournament, yes, there are more tries, but does that necessarily make it better, more intoxicating? Across a difficult four-year period in economic terms, Six Nations crowds have gone from an average of 69,531 to 68,968, a drop of less than 1%. That's good going in the climate. The Rugby Championship's crowds are down close to 12%. The opposing, pro-change view is that the Six Nations has become a bit tired and is in need of modernising. The Rugby Championship, the Champions Cup, the Premiership in England, the Pro12, the Top 14 in France and Super Rugby in the southern hemisphere all have the bonus-point system. In the Six Nations there is a view that the premium is on defence over attack. That argument can be overblown, but there's truth in it, too. Those who are supportive of the new bonus-point system see a vision of the future that will have a nation busting a gut to turn three tries into four in the latter stages of a Test, just to secure that extra point. Cue more attacking intent and more entertainment. That's the wish. For example, in the 2015 Six Nations, had England scored four tries against Scotland - and got a bonus point - instead of three they might have won the championship. The winners, Ireland, could apply the same logic to one of their games, of course. So could Wales. In 2014, had England added to their two first-half tries in their victory against Wales with another two in the second half they might have won that championship, too. They didn't. Ireland did - and it was hard-won and richly deserved. The final Saturday of both of those Six Nations were thrill-fests. Ireland secured the title with a hugely dramatic victory in Paris in 2014 and they won it again in 2015 with that most incredible trilogy where tries cascaded down on Ireland in Scotland, Wales in Italy and England against France. Three nations were in a mad-dash for the winning line. It was an utterly brilliant day, so why would you want to mess with the dynamic? There is no harm in tinkering. Experimentation is to be applauded, just as long as there's an open mind and that if bonus points are not seen to be working then they're put in the bin and the Six Nations is restored to its old, flawed, but thoroughly loveable self.", "question": "When the Six Nations committee decided to introduce a bonus - point system for the 2017 championship you could almost hear the @placeholder reactions in rugby heartlands in Britain and Ireland .", "option_0": "preferred", "option_1": "power", "option_2": "contrasting", "option_3": "affect", "option_4": "defining", "label": 2}
{"article": "Most people can readily conjure images inside their head - known as their mind's eye. But this year scientists have described a condition, aphantasia, in which some people are unable to visualise mental images. Niel Kenmuir, from Lancaster, has always had a blind mind's eye. He knew he was different even in childhood. \"My stepfather, when I couldn't sleep, told me to count sheep, and he explained what he meant, I tried to do it and I couldn't,\" he says. \"I couldn't see any sheep jumping over fences, there was nothing to count.\" Our memories are often tied up in images, think back to a wedding or first day at school. As a result, Niel admits, some aspects of his memory are \"terrible\", but he is very good at remembering facts. And, like others with aphantasia, he struggles to recognise faces. Yet he does not see aphantasia as a disability, but simply a different way of experiencing life. It is impossible to see what someone else is picturing inside their head. Psychologists use the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire, which asks you to rate different mental images, to test the strength of the mind's eye. The University of Exeter has developed an abridged version that lets you see how your mind compares. Try our version of the aphantasia test here Ironically, Niel now works in a bookshop, although he largely sticks to the non-fiction aisles. His condition begs the question what is going on inside his picture-less mind. I asked him what happens when he tries to picture his fiancee. \"This is the hardest thing to describe, what happens in my head when I think about things,\" he says. \"When I think about my fiancee there is no image, but I am definitely thinking about her, I know today she has her hair up at the back, she's brunette. \"But I'm not describing an image I am looking at, I'm remembering features about her, that's the strangest thing and maybe that is a source of some regret.\" The response from his mates is a very sympathetic: \"You're weird.\" But while Niel is very relaxed about his inability to picture things, it is a cause of distress for others. One person who took part in a study into aphantasia said he had started to feel \"isolated\" and \"alone\" after discovering that other people could see images in their heads. Being unable to reminisce about his mother years after her death led to him being \"extremely distraught\". At the other end of the spectrum is children's book illustrator, Lauren Beard, whose work on the Fairytale Hairdresser series will be familiar to many six-year-olds. Her career relies on the vivid images that leap into her mind's eye when she reads text from her author. When I met her in her box-room studio in Manchester, she was working on a dramatic scene in the next book. The text describes a baby perilously climbing onto a chandelier. \"Straightaway I can visualise this grand glass chandelier in some sort of French kind of ballroom, and the little baby just swinging off it and really heavy thick curtains,\" she says. \"I think I have a strong imagination, so I can create the world and then keep adding to it so it gets sort of bigger and bigger in my mind and the characters too they sort of evolve. \"I couldn't really imagine what it's like to not imagine, I think it must be a bit of a shame really.\" Not many people have mental imagery as vibrant as Lauren or as blank as Niel. They are the two extremes of visualisation. Adam Zeman, a professor of cognitive and behavioural neurology, wants to compare the lives and experiences of people with aphantasia and its polar-opposite hyperphantasia. His team, based at the University of Exeter, coined the term aphantasia this year in a study in the journal Cortex. Prof Zeman tells the BBC: \"People who have contacted us say they are really delighted that this has been recognised and has been given a name, because they have been trying to explain to people for years that there is this oddity that they find hard to convey to others.\" How we imagine is clearly very subjective - one person's vivid scene could be another's grainy picture. But Prof Zeman is certain that aphantasia is real. People often report being able to dream in pictures, and there have been reported cases of people losing the ability to think in images after a brain injury. He is adamant that aphantasia is \"not a disorder\" and says it may affect up to one in 50 people. But he adds: \"I think it makes quite an important difference to their experience of life because many of us spend our lives with imagery hovering somewhere in the mind's eye which we inspect from time to time, it's a variability of human experience.\" If you think you have aphantasia or hyperphantasia and would like to be involved in Prof Zeman's research he is happy to be contacted at a.zeman@exeter.ac.uk", "question": "Close your eyes and imagine walking along a sandy beach and then @placeholder over the horizon as the Sun rises .

{"article": "If the latest ceasefire in eastern Ukraine breaks down, then there will be increased pressure on President Barack Obama by hawks in Washington - Democrat as well as Republican - to provide arms to Ukraine, and on European leaders to acquiesce in this. In the view of a range of analysts and former officials on both sides of the Atlantic, this seems a singularly ill-thought out strategy. More importantly, the advocates of arming Ukraine do not appear either to have sufficiently analysed the actual balance of forces on the ground, or to have studied a key lesson from recent history: namely, what happened to Georgia when its government launched an offensive against separatist rebels and their Russian backers in South Ossetia in August 2008. After brief initial gains, the Georgian army was crushed by new Russian forces. This apparently lunatic Georgian move is only comprehensible if President Mikheil Saakashvili believed that the USA would intervene militarily to prevent Georgia's defeat. Of course it did not, nor had any such promise ever been made by the Bush administration. But the Georgians could have been forgiven for not realising that, given that they had received weapons, extravagant political support, and a promise of future Nato membership from Washington. What happened in Georgia? Against the background of this history, it cannot be emphasised too strongly that, for the foreseeable future, however many weapons the Ukrainian army receives from the USA, if it gets into an open fight with the Russian army, it is likely to lose, and lose catastrophically. So far, very limited numbers of lightly disguised Russian troops have been enough to bring to a standstill the entire fighting strength of the Ukrainian army - last autumn, the Nato estimate was that a mere 3,000 Russian soldiers were present in the Donbas. With massive US arms supplies, the Ukrainian army might well be able to launch an initially successful offensive against these forces and their local separatist allies. But what then? All the evidence suggests that the Russian government simply cannot afford the humiliation of a Ukrainian military victory. In other words, as in August 2008 in Georgia, Moscow would respond with greatly increased military force. In the highly unlikely event that the USA then sent its own troops to help Ukraine - which has already been repeatedly ruled out - we would be in a European war between nuclear powers. If it did not, the Ukrainian army would risk the high probability of defeat, and if so, the USA and Nato would be severely humiliated. In August 2008, after smashing the Georgian army, Russia briefly occupied parts of Georgia proper - beyond the borders of the separatist territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia - and then withdrew. Since neither Russia nor the separatists had any historical or ethnic claim on these strategically worthless Georgian territories, there was no reason for them to stay. Russian attitudes to eastern and southern Ukraine are very different. If the Russian army ever marches into Kharkov and Dnipropetrovsk, they are very likely to stay. Ukraine can survive without Donetsk, Lugansk and the Crimea. Indeed, it could be seen as a stronger and more homogenous state without them, as the election of President Petro Poroshenko demonstrated. The loss of a third of the country would be a very different matter. The partition of Ukraine would indeed mark a return to the Cold War, implying vastly increased European military spending, and colossally increased aid to Ukraine intended to prepare the country for early membership of the European Union - something for which the EU is utterly unprepared. The duty of Western leaders therefore is to try to make sure that the present ceasefire works. Despite the battle for Debaltseve, there is some chance that it may work - or at least, a better chance than that of previous attempts. This is above all because it includes a critical element missing from those attempts: a political solution tied to a specific timetable, and one which allows all the main parties to the conflict to achieve their most important goal (with the possible exception of the separatist leadership in the Donbas). Concurrently with the withdrawal of heavy weapons, dialogue is to begin on holding local elections in the rebel territories, in accordance with the Ukrainian law on provisional autonomy for the region. The Ukrainian parliament has to pass a resolution on this within 30 days of the ceasefire. By the end of 2015, Ukraine is to regain full control of its borders in the east; but also by the end of 2015, a new Ukrainian federal constitution has to be adopted incorporating special autonomous status for the Donbas. In the meantime, the government in Kiev will reopen economic ties with the Donbas and resume paying official salaries in the region - thereby helping in the process of reintegrating it into Ukraine. For Kiev and Western governments, this agreement secures their most important goal of preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, minus Crimea, with a central government which preserves the ability to conduct desperately needed reforms. This is a goal which could otherwise only be achieved through victorious war - and whatever hawks in the USA may think, any full-scale war between Ukraine and Russia will almost certainly result not in Ukrainian victory, but in a crushing Ukrainian defeat and the further dismemberment of the country. Moreover, trying to turn Ukraine into a country capable of planning such a war would require a degree of authoritarian nationalism which would move Ukraine not closer to the European Union, but even further away from it. For Russia, this deal preserves the Donbas as a distinct autonomous area within Ukraine. A federal constitution would also help guarantee the position of Russian-speaking areas of the country against any move to forced ukrainianisation from Kiev. From Moscow's point of view, this would also make it much more difficult to move Ukraine into the West's military camp without a strong consensus behind this in Ukrainian society - a consensus which was present in central European countries during their move to join Nato, but which has never existed in Ukraine. This is the main sticking point as far as hardliners in both Ukraine and the US are concerned: that the present deal will make Ukraine's membership in Nato and the EU impossible. In actual fact, however, these are non-issues. By repeatedly stating that under no circumstances will Nato troops be sent to defend Ukraine, Nato seems to have rendered the idea of Ukrainian membership an unlikely prospect. As for EU membership, it's unlikely any West European leader has ever considered this as more than the remotest of prospects, decades in the future and dependent on a whole series of extremely long and painful changes. This is a decision therefore which would in all circumstances have to be left to a future generation. Moreover, given the economic reality of Ukrainian economic dependence on Russia, salvaging Ukraine's collapsing economy can only be done in co-operation with Russia, not against her. Unless, that is, the EU is prepared to demand from West European populations enormous sacrifices for the sake of helping Ukraine. Anyone who believes that is likely should have a brief conversation with a Greek. For the ceasefire to hold and a political solution to be reached, the governments of France and Germany will have to show an unwonted degree of resolve and toughness over the next year. On the one hand, they will have to make clear to Moscow that the relaxations of sanctions against Russia will only come as a result of clear and consistent pressure on the Donbas rebels to abide by the terms of the ceasefire and to pursue autonomy within Ukraine, and not independence. On the other hand, they will need to make clear to the Ukrainian government and to hardliners in Washington that significant EU aid to Ukraine, and an eventual path to possible EU membership, both depend on Kiev honouring the promise of real autonomy for the Donbas. The present ceasefire and the associated political process are not perfect, but they present the best chance so far of ending this conflict, preserving by far the greater part of Ukraine as a unitary state, and avoiding an escalation of the war that would most probably be very bad for Russia and the West, and absolutely disastrous for Ukraine.

Mr McEvoy, a Plaid AM for South Wales Central and the party's group leader on Cardiff council, is facing a tribunal over allegations he brought the authority into disrepute in his role as a local councillor.

He said the case \"could have been heard at almost any point in November through February on a date that would not have conflicted with a critical date in the political calendar\".

{"article": "On Thursday, we were summoned to Stormont Castle and presented with a list of initiatives. So how ambitious were they? A target date of 2023 for bringing down the peace walls and other barriers is certainly eye catching - although it would have come as more of a shock if the BBC had not obtained a draft of the 10-year plan back in January. I joked with one official that we should really headline Thursday night's story: \"Stormont delays removal of walls by a year.\" Despite that, it is refreshing to hear local ministers committing themselves to such an ambitious goal. In the past they have left it to visiting VIPs like the New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to tell them that a city divided by physical barriers sends out all the wrong messages to the world. Drawing up a target is easier than achieving it, and many of those who live in the shadow of the peace walls will - especially after the tensions over the union flag dispute - fear the potential consequences of any premature removal. But the direction of travel is hard to argue with. Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness's peace plan is definitely a decimal document. Ten years to bring down the walls, ten new shared educational campuses, ten new shared neighbourhoods, 100 summer camps and 10,000 placements for young people not in work, training or education. You can see why they didn't opt for 13 as the common denominator. Whether they achieve all the round numbers will be interesting to assess - one Alliance politician I bumped into claimed it was proving impossible to fill the training places for young people already on offer. But again, the aspiration appears laudable. Not so long ago a visiting foreign diplomat asked me why Stormont did not introduce a form of national service to promote citizenship amongst disaffected young people. I explained why differences over national identity and/or military service would make such an idea a non-starter. That said, the \"United Youth Programme\", with its emphasis on citizenship, sharing, work experience and volunteering sounds as close as Stormont could get. Along with an emphasis on cross community sports, few could reject the idea outright, although some might wonder how new such schemes are. Predictably other Stormont parties have given the DUP-Sinn Fein announcement a dusty response - the SDLP called it a rehash of the items previously under discussion as part of the Cohesion, Sharing and Integration (CSI) strategy. Alliance described it as a collection of \"one-off, back of the envelope initiatives\". But in a previous era, London and Dublin often came in for criticism when they sought to break deadlocks by putting their heads together then pushing forward with their best guess at a compromise everyone could live with. In the devolved era, the DUP and Sinn Fein find themselves playing a a slightly similar role, although the fact that they are dealing with their electoral opponents adds an extra edge to the cross-party discord. Will an independent chair be able to broker deals on flags, parades and the past when the previous Stormont working group has failed to reach a consensus? That will depend not only on the personality and experience of the individual, but also whether they are seen to have sufficient authority. Although the first and deputy first ministers argue there is no real connection, it is undeniable that Thursday's step forward followed pressure from the secretary of state and the prime minister, linking fresh economic support to the need for more progress on a shared future. The US government was quick to welcome the Stormont announcement. It may be that Washington, London and Dublin still have a role to play, either by putting their diplomatic weight behind whoever chairs the cross-party talks on flags, parades and the past or perhaps by contributing some much needed fresh ideas for how to go about cracking these hardest of hard nuts.", "question": "Northern Ireland 's first and deputy first ministers have been promising us ambitious plans on a shared future in recent weeks , but @placeholder nothing in the way of detail .", "option_0": "providing", "option_1": "reported", "option_2": "declared", "option_3": "garnered", "option_4": "sparked", "label": 0}

But as a player, he was present when the national side last qualified for a major tournament in Mexico in 1986. He is well placed to offer an assessment on the scale of the current team's achievement and the pressures involved. \"I think it is a fantastic achievement by the players and manager and for the supporters who have been there through thick and thin,\" he said. \"The finals in France are something for them to look forward to and enjoy. They should take huge pride in what they have achieved. \"There was a period when Michael was manager when he went a number of games without a win, but he stuck with it and never gave up.

He said there was little time for celebration after the game, but recalled with fondness the post-match television interview of central defender, the late Alan McDonald. \"The celebration was short-lived, it was a Wednesday night, you went over to the fans, but then you were back in training with your club on the Thursday,\" he added. \"I remember Big Mac saying in the interview 'if anyone thinks that was a fix they can come and see me'. \"That was typical of Big Mac, he played with passion and pride and never let his head drop. \"He spoke from the heart.\" The former Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds United full-back said it took time to digest that success and he thinks it will be the same for O'Neill's players. \"At Wembley in 1985 it took a while to sink in and the current Northern Ireland players will experience this, it drip feeds into your system over the weeks until the end of the season and the start of the finals,\" he said. \"Then you look back on what you have achieved. \"I remember the pre-tournament training in Guadalajara in Mexico when we reached the finals, it was tough trying to acclimatise. \"The whole spectacle around the World Cup, the different teams being there and the supporters, was really fantastic.\" Worthington also had a simple message for the players who now have the opportunity to sample Northern Ireland's first ever appearance at a European Championship finals. \"You are already the pride of Northern Ireland after this huge achievement, go and play with a smile on your face,\" he added.", "question": "Amidst the celebrations at Windsor Park in Belfast following Northern Ireland 's victory over Greece on Thursday night , one man in the stadium could have been @placeholder if he wanted a quiet moment of contemplation .", "option_0": "seated", "option_1": "forgiven", "option_2": "influenced", "option_3": "named", "option_4": "dismissed", "label": 1}

He has rejected the allegations and vowed to clear his name. But he went missing a few weeks afterwards and was only arrested six months later in a hotel in Guatemala. Mr Duarte was detained in the city of Solola in a joint operation between Interpol and Guatemalan police. He is suspected of having siphoned off at least 645 million Mexican pesos ($35m; \u00c2\u00a328m) of public money that was put into a series of shell companies. During a search of his luxury ranch in Mexico, police also found 17 paintings believed to be by famous artists such as Joan Mir\u00c3\u00b3, Fernando Botero and Leonora Carrington. There was an explosion in violence and corruption in the state during his six years in office, in particular a spike in the number of murders and disappearances. Under Mr Duarte, Veracruz also became the most dangerous region of the country for journalists, with 17 killed during his term.

{"article": "Throughout the countryside there are thorn bushes growing all alone in the middle of fields Some people believe that the bushes are the homes of the fairies, and, if anyone tries to cut them down or damage them, it is likely they will die young, or become seriously ill. Earlier we published our archive report from 1964 about the local people in Downpatrick talking about the fate that will befall those who have disrespected fairy traditions by cutting down Fairy Thorns. So where does an incredibly sceptic journalist go to be convinced about fairies? Well my granny Evelyn of course - as I remember her telling about fairies at Matties Rock in Bushmills when we were growing up. She told me everyone in Bushmills knew about the fairies on the rock and that her brothers and sisters were actually a bit scared of them. Our archive report promoted a lots of readers to get in touch with their stories. One listener got in touch with BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme to let us know about a fairy thorn that was growing at Ormeau Golf Club. Denis McKnight, who is the secretary of the club, said it has been there longer than anyone can remember. \"The club was opened in 1893 so it's at least 122 years old and goes right back,\" he said. \"None of our green keepers will touch it or cut it down. They won't even trim it Mr McKnight said that balls had been lost in the tree and never seen again. \"If you hit the tree and don't apologise you're guaranteed to have a bad game,\" he said. \"When people visit the club we have to warn them about the fairy thorn. We tell them to nod to it as they go past and they have to apologise if they hit it.\" Although Denis is not aware of any members seeing any actual fairies, even after coming out of the clubhouse after a late night. He said the club used the thorn on their logo for a while and that they will never cut it down. \"It's far too important to us now to try and cut it down,\" he said. Anne got in touch to say that her grandmother-in-law had planted a red thorn tree on their land and then planners would not let her take it down when they were building their new house. \"Obviously it's not just superstitious farmers who are scared of fairies,\" she said. Anne now lives beside the fairy thorn and would not dream of cutting it down. One of the slip roads off the motorway from Ballymena to Antrim at Saucers Hill was built around a fairy thorn as locals didn't want to see it cut down. Maria McCann got in touch to say there is a fairy thorn on Gilford Road and Lurgan and that she makes a wish every time she goes past. One reader even suggested that the ill-fated DeLorean factory may have had an encounter with some bitter fairies and their tree. \"Contractors building the DeLorean car plant at Dunmurry are said to have cut one down,\" they said.

Insider attacks - on international and Afghan forces - have became one of the gravest security threats of the later phase of the conflict in Afghanistan, although the rate of such incidents has dropped in recent years.

One of the worst insider attacks took place last August when a US general was killed in an attack by an Afghan soldier at a British-run military academy near Kabul. US Major General Harold Greene was the most senior American military officer to die in action overseas since the Vietnam War.

{"article": "Crouching between a high rise estate and a busy dual carriageway, the slow-flowing river looks nondescript until it comes to a large caged concrete tunnel, thrusting under the city's ring road. This is the where the River Sherbourne, once vital for early settlers, disappears from view and becomes a hidden river: contained, covered and contaminated. Historians believe the river was much larger in Anglo-Saxon times and would have supplied fish and drinking water to small hamlets in the Forest of Arden, the forerunners to Coventry itself. Despite its current condition, classified by the Environment Agency as \"poor\" (or two out of five for quality), some believe the Sherbourne could be liquid gold for tourism in the regenerating city. The river, which disappeared into a culvert under city centre development in the 1960s, could be worth \u00a31.5bn in flood action savings and increased property prices and business investment, according to a Defra-funded report by Aecom. The River Sherbourne makes a brief reappearance in the city centre, among the bins and back doors of shops behind Cross Cheaping, where its rotten smell, like damp decomposing cabbages, unmistakably rises from its murky flow. Aecom, whose research was commissioned by the government's technology strategy board, estimated it would cost about \u00a33.3m to open up a central section of the river, making it visible to tourists and residents. \"By allowing green infrastructure to do a proper job in a city, you make it a nice place... and the buildings around rivers enjoy higher property values,\" said Michael Henderson, its associate director. The report identifies four places to uncover the river, saying it would attract people and business to the city centre, \"create excellent public realm and walking routes\" and improve the water quality of the light and oxygen-starved hidden water. Early maps show the river, which starts north west of the city near Corley, was steadily controlled and covered throughout the 20th Century, before the city's post-war rebuilding hid it almost completely. Colin Walker, from the Coventry Society, said: \"Coventry almost certainly owes its founding and development largely to the river. While we now dismiss it as not much more than a sewer, in medieval times it was a very useful tool. \"The six monasteries... all ran sheep and processing the wool made Coventry a very rich city.\" One of the society's other members, Paul Maddocks, champions the idea of opening up the city centre river and, in 1995, drew up a plan to present to the council. His idea was to use the river as a centrepiece in a pedestrian square and industrial heritage quarter, but he failed to win backing from councillors. Recently urban explorers have defied its danger signs and trespassed to explore the culverts, anonymously posting videos and blogging about \"cool stalagmites, pipes and waterfalls\". Artists have imagined the role of the river if uncovered again, as Julian Beever created a pavement chalk drawing illusion and Kathryn Hawkins drilled the river route in the concrete floor of a city shop. Miss Hawkins said: \"Coventry wouldn't be here if the river wasn't here. The ring road is a dominant image now, 45 years ago the river was still a dominant feature of the city centre. \"The ring road came into being and the river... ceased to be visible.\" Once free of the city, the Sherbourne joins the River Sowe near Baginton and eventually flows into the River Avon, which is well used for tourism in Warwickshire. Unlike its well-known cousin, the Sherbourne is too small to be navigable, but could still have a use in the regeneration of Coventry, depending on the future of the government funded research. Coventry City Council would not comment on the likelihood of the report schemes being realised, but the Coventry Society's Mr Maddocks said he remains hopeful. He said: \"The Sherbourne is the reason why Coventry started here around 700AD, then grew to be one of the most important Medieval cities in the country. \"Most towns and cities celebrate their river, hopefully we will too.\"", "question": "BBC News @placeholder the hidden River Sherbourne , covered by city centre development , that a report claims could be worth \u00a3 1.5 bn for Coventry .", "option_0": "reached", "option_1": "revealed", "option_2": "nicknamed", "option_3": "follows", "option_4": "described", "label": 3}

They gathered around the fair in George Square, in darkness as a mark of respect, and the floral tributes outside the Gallery of Modern Art. They stood in silence to remember those who had been affected by the tragedy. A woman stood beside the road on Queen Street sobbing heavily, comforted by a companion. Another quietly sobbed as she looked at the floral tributes outside the Gallery of Modern Art. Many more stopped for a minute as they walked past the flowers to read the messages left with them. Some of the flowers had been left by friends and relatives who were affected by the tragedy but most were placed anonymously by members of the public. They served as a reminder for many of the shoppers and and city-centre workers who may otherwise have forgotten the tragedy's first anniversary. Several times today, passers-by questioned their companions about why the flowers had been laid. Some did not know, but when the bin lorry crash was referenced usually it was followed by a respectful silence. It was an overcast day in George Square, but the scene was brightened by a big bunch of yellow flowers. They were laid by two young colleagues of Erin McQuade, who was 18 when she died in the tragedy. The pair worked with her at Cameron House. As they laid the bunch of yellow flowers outside of the Gallery of Modern Art, one said: \"We picked these flowers because they were so bright and we thought it was a nice way to remember her on what is obviously a sad day. \"It has really affected all of her colleagues.

Markle was born on 4 August 1981 and grew up in Los Angeles but now lives in Toronto. She studied at a girls' Roman Catholic college before graduating from Northwestern University School of Communication in 2003, just as her acting career was beginning. Between auditions, she has told of making money by doing calligraphy for wedding invitations, using skills developed in handwriting classes at school. Her father was a TV lighting director and her first television appearance in the US was in an episode of the medical drama General Hospital in 2002, before moving on to roles in CSI, Without A Trace and Castle. Markle then began appearing in major Hollywood films, including Get Him To The Greek, Remember Me and Horrible Bosses. She has also appeared in the sci-fi series Fringe, playing FBI special agent Amy Jessup, and is perhaps most famous for her role in Suits, which is shown on the Dave channel and Netflix in the UK. In September 2011, she married film producer Trevor Engelson after dating for seven years, but the pair divorced two years later. Markle is also the editor-in-chief of her lifestyle website and brand The Tig, which covers food, beauty, fashion and travel. She said setting up the website was an attempt to \"reframe the beauty content to include think pieces about self-empowerment\" and feature dynamic, inspirational women. In a post on The Tig, she explained: \"I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches - I've always wanted to be a woman who works.\" She has also grown a large social network following, with 1.1 million people following her posts on Instagram and over 330,000 Twitter followers. Earlier this year, Markle became the Global Ambassador for World Vision Canada, which campaigns for better education, food and healthcare for children around the world. As part of her role, the actress travelled to Rwanda for the charity's Clean Water Campaign. As well as her humanitarian work, she is known for campaigning for gender equality. Aged 11, she forced a soap manufacturer to alter an advert after she wrote a letter to then First Lady Hillary Clinton and other high-profile figures complaining that it implied women belonged in the kitchen. Markle's commitment to gender equality has seen her work with the United Nations, and she received a standing ovation from an audience including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for a speech she made on International Women's Day 2015. Commenting on how she combines acting with her humanitarian commitments, she said: \"While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, co-exist.

The incident happened on 2 October, north of the IS-held city of Mosul. IS militants are said to have tried to use drones to launch attacks at least two other times in the past month. In response, US-led coalition and Iraqi pro-government forces have been warned to treat any type of small flying aircraft as a potential bomb, according to the New York Times. But few units have been provided with devices that US troops have to disarm them. The French newspaper Le Monde reported on Tuesday that the drone involved in the attack 10 days ago had been intercepted in flight and had exploded near the Peshmerga and French soldiers when it crashed to the ground. A US official told the New York Times the Peshmerga had been examining the drone when a small explosive device disguised as a battery blew up. It was not clear whether the bomb was detonated remotely or contained a timer. On Wednesday, the secretary general of the Kurdistan Region's defence ministry, Jabbar al-Yawar, confirmed the death toll and said the French soldiers had been training the Peshmerga at the time of the attack. The wounded French troops were immediately evacuated to France for medical treatment, Le Monde said, adding that one was \"between life and death\". The French government initially declined to comment on the incident, but a spokesman confirmed on Wednesday that French special forces had been injured. France has sent about 500 troops to Iraq as part of the coalition against IS.

Bourne has written the show with collaborator Elliot Davis. The pair's first musical was Loserville, which was staged by YMT in 2009 before going on to the West End and being nominated for an Olivier Award. The story of What I Go To School For is \"very truthful\" at heart, according to Bourne. \"The show quite accurately tells story of the band from 2001 to 2005, though some characters are real and some characters are made-up versions of real people. \"Eventually it would be nice to open in the West End after we've had more time to develop.\" As well as working on the musical, Bourne has been back in the recording studio with the band after a break of 10 years.

The star of Pitch Perfect 2 is on the promotional trail for the third time this year, making a flying visit to London before going back to work on one of the seven films she has lined up for the next 18 months. \"I can't tell if I'm really jetlagged,\" she laughs, \"but I woke up at three in the morning and, just five minutes ago, I told someone 'goodnight' instead of 'goodbye', so we'll see how this goes.\" Despite this, she's as irreverent and zesty in person as she is on Twitter - devilishly suggesting we use our interview slot to catch some shut eye. \"Five minutes of us sleeping would make compelling TV,\" she argues.

She brings a down-to-earth, acerbic edge to all of her films and public appearances, while managing to be warm and likeable. To adapt a well-worn cliche, girls want to be her, and guys want to be her, too. She's that cool. Kendrick first came to attention in her Oscar-nominated role as a no-nonsense management consultant in George Clooney's Up In The Air, but it's in musicals that she's made her name. She got her professional start on Broadway, and was nominated for a Tony Award for playing Dinah in High Society when she was just 12. The original Pitch Perfect - a comedy musical about the quirky world of competitive a capella - was her first lead role and a surprise sleeper hit. Produced for a meagre $17 million, it made $113 million at the box office and another $103 million in home video sales.  It even gave Kendrick a top 10 single in the US. The success made a second movie all-but inevitable. But comedy sequels are notoriously difficult. And musical sequels are even worse. \"Wait, have there been many musical sequels?\" asks Kendrick, astonished. \"I never even thought of this!\" A quick brainstorm brings up Love Never Dies, the ill-fated follow-up to Phantom of the Opera, as well as film flops Blues Brothers 2000 and Grease 2. \"But Grease 2 is kind of fabulous in its own way,\" Kendrick argues, breaking into Michelle Pfeiffer's Cool Rider... A song which brings to mind the full horror of the film. \"No, it's a terrible movie,\" she corrects herself. \"I agree with that.\" Historically speaking, then, the prospects for Pitch Perfect 2 were suitably dim. \"People keep saying that,\" laughs director Elizabeth Banks. \"It's almost as if they're rooting for us to fail.\" Kendrick is more sanguine. \"To me, it felt like the pressure was off because I knew people wanted to see Pitch Perfect 2,\" she says. \"When you do almost every other film, you have no idea if anybody's going to be interested in sitting down and watching your stupid movie.\" Pitch Perfect was based on the true story of an all-female a capella troupe who fought their way to the national finals of a college singing competition. It was adapted from a non-fiction book by Mickey Rapkin, but it was the catty, shrewdly-observed characters - invented by 30 Rock writer Kay Cannon - that gave the movie its real heart. Kendrick played Beca, a spunky freshman dragged reluctantly into the Barden Bellas; but the stand-out was Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy (self-professed so \"twig bitches like you don't do it behind my back\"), who shamelessly stole scenes from the rest of the cast. \"I've got a trophy cabinet now, thanks to Pitch Perfect!\" says the Australian actress. \"The MTV Movie Awards are pretty cool, 'cause they look like popcorn. And sometimes in the middle of the night, you're like 'that's not real popcorn, that's gold!'\" The sequel broadens the scope - as the Barden Bellas square off against German aca-champions Das Sound Machine (an arrogant bunch of \"Deutschbags\") in an international singing contest. But not before Fat Amy destroys the girls' reputation with a mid-air wardrobe malfunction. \"Yeah - there's a 'muffgate', when I expose myself to the President of America,\" Wilson deadpans. \"I did have to train very hard to do that 40-second stunt,\" she says of her acrobatic exposure. \"I only did three takes of the actual routine at 27 feet because it's very dangerous to hang upside down for a long period of time. \"But luckily I smashed it and got to go home early. And then we did a couple of cut-away takes of me hanging upside down by the butt.\" The sequence, filmed at the Lincoln Center, is indicative of the increased ambition (and budget) of the sequel, all of which presented a challenge for first-time director Elizabeth Banks - who also plays commentator Gail Abernathy-McKadden. \"I think I was very naive,\" she laughs. \"I was very confident going in. But it is, of course, a challenge, to give people more of what they loved about the first film but also expand the world. \"What helped is that we had a sweet, small, university-set story the first time around and we had a great opportunity to blow it up this time. \"The musical numbers were all bigger and crazier and more comedic. We just leaned into what people already liked.\" Despite the pressure, Banks, an accomplished comedic actress, allowed her cast to improvise extensively on set. The jokes occasionally got out of hand (expect an 18-rated gag reel), but the best lines undoubtedly go to John Michael Higgins, who plays a staggeringly sexist commentator, calling the Bellas \"an inspiration to girls all over the country who are too ugly to be cheerleaders\". \"He's one of the great improv artists of all time, and he's not afraid of anything,\" says Banks. \"I think comedy has to be very fearless or it just gets bland.\" Kendrick adds: \"There'd be times when we would be doing improv and I'd think 'this is never going in the movie,' but it is! \"I think we definitely pushed it a little further in this one, and somehow managed to sneak it in.\" And if the film matches the success of the first one, is a three-quel on the cards? Banks, who spent so much time editing Pitch Perfect 2 that \"all I see now are the mistakes\", says she won't make a decision in haste. \"If people embrace it in the way we hope that they do, we will absolutely talk seriously about what the next part of this journey could be,\" she says. But she has reservations about where the story of the Bellas could go. \"I think we have to do a big right turn and do something completely different, otherwise we'll be facing off against aliens,\" she laughs. \"We'll be the Avengers of a capella.\" Pitch Perfect 2 reaches cinemas on 15 May, 2015.", "question": "Pitch Perfect 2 is the follow - up to a surprise hit about a university a capella @placeholder - but can it live up to the beloved original ?", "option_0": "musical", "option_1": "group", "option_2": "laboratory", "option_3": "heart", "option_4": "mass", "label": 1}

{"article": "As adept at crafting concert films and documentaries as he was with thrillers, comedies and emotional family dramas, his list of credits shows him to be versatile as well as prolific. Everyone will have their favourites. Personally I have a soft spot for Something Wild, a darkly comic romance from 1986 in which Jeff Daniels realises a date with Melanie Griffith comes with a psychotic ex attached. But if you had to choose the five films that best illustrate his formidable range, you could do a lot worse than picking the following: A footnote in the life of eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes formed the basis for this early success. It riffs on the much-disputed relationship between Hughes and Melvin Dummar, a service station owner from Utah who claimed to be one of Hughes's beneficiaries after his 1976 death. It's a quirky story that enabled Demme to muse on the pitfalls of instant celebrity and the way a sudden windfall makes everyone your friend. Mary Steenburgen won an Oscar for playing Melvin's first wife, while Bo Goldman was also rewarded by the Academy for his screenplay. Few directors have captured the electricity and excitement of live performance better than Jonathan Demme. For proof, one need look no further than this film of Talking Heads in concert, shot over three nights in 1983. Featuring such hits as Psycho Killer, Burning Down the House and Once in a Lifetime, it's a perfect marriage of music, cinema and humour. The latter is provided by David Byrne's suit, which gets progressively larger, and absurder, as the film goes on. Another live performance we can enjoy again and again thanks to Demme comes in this vivid record of one of Spalding Gray's acclaimed stage monologues. Focusing on the sometime actor's involvement in 1984 film The Killing Fields, it's a piece that addresses, both comically and poetically, America's own involvement in south-east Asian affairs. Laurie Anderson's score combines with Gray's hypnotising skills as a storyteller to make a riveting hybrid. Demme wasn't the first film-maker to bring Hannibal Lecter to the screen. That honour belonged to Michael Mann and his 1986 thriller Manhunter. Lambs, though, was the one the Academy recognised, awarding it all of the \"big five\" Oscars - best picture, actor, actress, director and screenplay. The film - and Sir Anthony Hopkins' Lecter - still have the power to chill the blood with its grisly autopsy scenes and Grand Guignol atmosphere. What lingers most, though, is the psychological richness and complexity of a film that, uncommonly at the time, put a female heroine - Jodie Foster's dogged Clarice Starling - at the forefront of the action. Two years on from Lambs' Oscar sweep, Tom Hanks won the first of his two back-to-back Oscars for his role as a lawyer with HIV fighting workplace discrimination. The film did much to remove the stigma associated with Aids at the time, not least by earning more than $200m (\u00c2\u00a3156m) at the worldwide box office. \"We wanted to reach people who don't know people with Aids, who look down on people with Aids,\" Demme told Rolling Stone in 1994. \"We were calculated about it.

{"article": "However, it emerged earlier that all is not entirely oojah-cum-spiff in the First Ministerial domestic household on the topic of Festive forestry. Ms Sturgeon disclosed that she and her estimable husband, Peter Murrell, always fall out while decorating the tree - but get there in the end. Mr Murrell, it should be said, is customarily one of the calmest individuals in existence. Forgive this havering on the subject of trees. It was prompted by a question from the Conservative backbencher Edward Mountain. The word from the Mountain, once translated, was that forestry was for life, not just for Christmas. He pleaded with the FM to back Caledonian topiary - before resuming his seat, gesturing magnanimously with his sizeable hand to signal that it was Ms Sturgeon's shottie. The Presiding Officer who, unaccountably, reckoned it was up to him to call upon speakers nevertheless acquiesced and matched the Mountainous command. The First Minister was called. And did she wish Yuletide greetings upon one and all, with a beneficent grin? Friends, she did not. Rather, she noted that - when it came to land use - the Tories tended to favour the few, rather than the many. The Mountain looked notably gloomy, as if surrounded by cloud. Mind you, Ms Sturgeon was only giving as good as she got on the Festive front. Opposition leaders each opened with a brief, cheery Festive benison. But they swiftly turned to the Yuletide game of the day: giving the Scottish Government a prolonged kicking. Ruth Davidson got there first for the Conservatives. (Not hard in that she is called first.) Ms Davidson raised the subject of the Auditor General's report anent police funding. The AG, as you will read elsewhere on this site, was less than complimentary. In essence, her complaint is that the books of the Scottish Police Authority are not in a good way - and that longer-term funding for the police may fall short of proclaimed requirements. Ms Davidson addressed the topic like a station sergeant taking a statement from a miscreant in that she appeared notably disinclined to give Ms Sturgeon the benefit of any doubt. We learned one more thing about Nicola Sturgeon this week. She has a phobia towards dogs. She quails at the prospect of a canine encounter. Mind you, she managed to overcome this sufficiently to cuddle a puppy for the cameras, lightly and very briefly. It would seem however that her fear does not extend to her political opponents. Certainly, she opted to attack over the police books - arguing that reforms were in place and that the bobbies' budget would be somewhat better if the UK government would relent and stop charging the Scottish force VAT. Sgt Davidson was undeterred. Her retort, subbed down, was: \"Heard it!\" She was last seen leaving the chamber in search of an Alsatian or poodle, according to availability, with which to confront the FM. Up stepped Labour's Kezia Dugdale. As billed earlier, she tried a quick \"Merry Christmas\" before repeating the police budget charge sheet. Indeed, she accused the FM of trying to sneak it out a few hours before recess. Ms Sturgeon looked and sounded indignant. The timing, she said, had given her opponents an example to question her at length on the topic. She did not say - but probably thought - that, if she had wanted to escape questions, she would have published it tomorrow. Willie Rennie pursued a topic which he has made his own: that of provision for mental health. On this occasion, the Liberal Democrat leader questioned the FM over such care in prison. Ms Sturgeon was notably emollient. One, this is a deeply sensitive topic. Two, she openly conceded that mental health care has been neglected \"for generations\". Three, she might need the Lib Dems to back the SG budget - and mental health provision could be a key issue. Any more? Yes, we had John Mason, the SNP backbencher, challenging the UK government over plans to make holders of public office swear an oath to uphold British values. Mr Mason said he, for one, did not feel particularly British. Ms Sturgeon too seemed unimpressed. She felt such a move was a premature response to the wider Casey report into social cohesion. She doubted whether enforced oaths would assist the integration of diverse communities. Have an utterly splendid Yule.

The island, which is known as both Towan Island and Jago Island, is reached by a private suspension footbridge.

Work on the house is only 90% finished, \"which will allow the buyer to design and specify the final 10%\". Maybe some taps for the concrete bath would be on the list. This house, named Tracks End, started life as a third-class Midland Railway carriage.

Now industries are failing to produce enough goods, imports are outpacing exports and the country is running out of money, again. The central bank has announced plans to introduce a new surrogate currency within the next month but no date has been announced. \"Maybe bonds will end queues, if it means we can sleep in our beds again, it might be the only solution.

They have called for President Robert Mugabe to step down for failing to stem the economic crisis. The announcement of a new currency has also sparked old fears of hyperinflation and fuelled panic withdrawals, especially among the tens of thousands of traders who need foreign currency to buy goods in South Africa for sale locally. \"There is a lot of uncertainty. We are afraid of bond notes because we don't have confidence in it,\" says Stanley Kufandirove as he waits in the queue. \"If its going to help us it's fine, but the issue is confidence - unless we believe in this bond note, it won't work.\" An elderly woman who works as a cleaner is more hopeful: \"Maybe bonds will end queues, if it means we can sleep in our beds again, it might be the only solution. It doesn't matter that they don't [have] value outside the country.\" Zimbabwe's central bank has produced media jingles and plans to embark on a road show to ally public fears. It denies that the bond notes are a way of reintroducing the Zimbabwe dollar through the back door. Rather they will be paid out as an incentive to mineral and agricultural exporters at a rate of 5% for every dollar earned. The bank's governor John Mangudya says they will not overprint the note, which is backed by a US $200m facility. Mr Mangudya has told the public: \"If you don't want the bond notes, use plastic money.\" But the mistrust continues. An elderly man who didn't want to be identified says he still has trillions of worthless notes stuffed in boxes at home. \"Why should we expect more? It's all the same fake money.\" Themba Dube is resigned: \"They are giving us bond tissues, worthless money, but where are they putting the hard currency? \"We are our on knees as a people, we have no choice and it might help to end queues. \"Even if they decide to give us leaves we will accept them. But before the bond notes come, I want to withdraw my cash and leave the account empty.\" Read more about Zimbabwe's economic crisis Zimbabwe shutdown: What is behind the protests?

{"article": "The two-year long study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) included nearly 500 overweight volunteers who were asked to diet and take more exercise. Half were given a fitness tracker to help them keep tabs. This group had lost less weight than the other one by the end of the trial. The study authors say this does not mean people should ditch the technology altogether, but neither should they put too much faith in them, at least as a slimming aid. Manufacturers say that the  technology has moved on since the study, and that their own research suggests activity trackers can help with weight loss alongside diet and exercise regimes. Despite the popularity of activity trackers, there have been very few studies to see what actual impact they have on weight and fitness levels. The University of Pittsburgh research is one of the first randomised trials to gather such evidence. The investigators found that over the course of the study, the volunteers who wore the fitness trackers had lost, on average, about 8lb (3.6kg). In comparison, the control group that were not given these devices lost about 13lb (5.9kg). The study authors say there are many possible explanations for this surprising finding but, as yet, no proof. Lead researcher Dr John Jakicic said: \"People have a tendency to use gadgets like these for a while and then lose interest with time as the novelty wears off. \"And we did see a drop off in the usage data as the study went on.\" Perhaps people who use fitness trackers became fixated on exercise goals and forgot to follow the diet advice, Dr Jakicic suggested. \"You might think to yourself, 'I'm being so active I can eat a cupcake now,'\" he said. Dr Jakicic said he would like to explore if certain people were more likely than others to benefit from using the technology. For example, a person who was very goal-driven might find tracking their exercise regime very motivating. - but others might just find it depressing. \"It might be very discouraging if you can see that you are not hitting your target all the time,\" he said. He acknowledged that technology had moved on since the study began, but he did not think that would alter the findings. \"What these devices tell us and how we use the information has not changed,\" he said. According to research company CCS Insight, UK sales of wearable devices - activity trackers and smart watches - are expected to reach five million, with 10 million devices expected to be in use before the end of 2016. Dr David Ellis, a psychologist at Lancaster University, who has been researching the rise of consumer health wearables said the JAMA study was helpful because it focused on people who might not normally go out and buy an activity tracker. \"Fitness trackers are more likely to be bought by people who already lead a healthy lifestyle and want to monitor their progress. So it's hard to say if they are useful for everybody,\" he said. \"In real life, obviously, most people won't get the level of support to lose weight that the people in this study did. \"They would have to do it on their own, so wearing a device might be better than nothing.

I was supposed to be rested [by South Africa] but I felt like going home and doing nothing was not going to benefit me at all. I needed to play.\" Steyn's appearances for Gujarat Lions were limited because the franchise was dependent on its overseas batsmen, and there is a limit of four non-Indians per match in the IPL. He had previously been sidelined after breaking a bone in his shoulder in the first Test against England in Durban in December 2015, having dismissed Alastair Cook for nought. Steyn revealed his link with Glamorgan came about when fellow South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel, who was due to play for the Welsh side, was recalled by the national side for a one-day series. \"Morne Morkel was supposed to come here and he got selected to go to the Caribbean and I was rested, but I just wanted to get out and play some cricket,\" Steyn added. \"He said 'maybe you should get hold of [Glamorgan captain] Jacques Rudolph because I was going to go to Glamorgan', and within an hour I was on the phone to [Glamorgan chief executive] Hugh Morris. By the next day I was on my way to get a visa and here I am. \"I'm just excited to be here because I haven't played a lot of cricket this year.\" Steyn will make his Glamorgan debut on Wednesday at the SSE Swalec Stadium against Essex, for whom he played in 2005. \"It's really cool.

{"article": "\"God covers them when they come out of water,\" said Abu Bakr Al Soussi sombrely. The young Libyan photographer documented this unidentified corpse, and almost 20 others, on the shores at Garabulli, east of the capital, Tripoli, in March. As a volunteer with the Red Crescent, he may have to photograph many more. They are part of a strange and terrible harvest from the seas - the nameless dead of the Mediterranean. So far this year, more than 3,000 migrants and refugees have been claimed by the waves as they tried to reach Europe, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). But Betty, a 29-year-old single mother from Nigeria who did not want her surname to be published, is undaunted at the prospect of crossing the sea in an overcrowded inflatable boat.  Small wonder perhaps. She has already been deceived, trafficked across the Sahara desert, beaten, and brutalised. A smuggler back home had promised her a job in Egypt. But after she paid him 200,000 Nigerian naira ($645; \u00a3490), she was loaded onto a truck for a harrowing journey to Tripoli. \"A lot of people die in the desert. When anybody fell down, they were not going to wait. I saw so many dead bodies. I was crying,\" she told the BBC. \"If you shout you would be killed, instantly. Even when we lay down in the desert, we did not know we were sleeping on top of a dead body.  It was when we removed our blankets that we saw - ah this is a skeleton. \" On arrival in Libya, there was \"another pain entirely\", Betty said. She was delivered to a gang which tried to force her into prostitution. She had to buy her freedom by borrowing more money. Now she has paid another trafficker 1,200 Libyan dinars ($860;\u00a3655) to take her to Europe. She says she has no choice. \"I need to go because I am a single mother of two boys. I need to go to Germany,\" Betty told the BBC. \"Things are not easy there too I know, but it's much better than Nigeria. My children need to go to school. They need to have a better life.\" Mohammed Garbaj of the Tripoli Coastguard has come across many like Betty, dead and alive. The wiry and weather-beaten skipper has rescued countless numbers, but is haunted by those he could not save. \"One time we went to rescue a boat but unfortunately we found only one person alive,\" he said. \"All the others had drowned - there were 120 of them. The people who send them on these boats are not good Muslims. They are heartless, sending people to die in the sea.\" We joined Mr Garbaj on a search for smugglers and migrants in distress, leaving port in a 12-metre inflatable.  It is the only seaworthy vessel the Tripoli coastguard has - they cannot afford to repair the other three. In pitch darkness Mr Garbaj and his crew switched off their engine and listened out for migrants' vessels. There was little else they could do. They did not have night-vision goggles, and their radar did not detect small boats. They admitted it was the traffickers who ruled the waves. \"The smugglers have more boats and more weapons,\" said Mohammed Boushagour, a young crewmate. \"They have long-range guns. They can escort the migrants to European waters and we can't do anything to stop them. The state doesn't support us. We haven't been paid since March,\" he added. Coastguard officials say there is another problem - Operation Sophia. The European Union mission, which operates just beyond Libya's territorial waters, was supposed to disrupt smuggling. Instead, it is providing \"a taxi service for migrants\", Colonel Ashraf Al Badri, head of the Tripoli Anti-Smuggling Unit, told the BBC. \"From my point of view, it's indirectly encouraging the migrants to go to Europe. Now, they have to travel just 12 miles. Then Operation Sophia rescues them. They are given food and taken to Europe,\" he said. \"Of course, this information spreads. The migrants all know that instead of a dangerous journey lasting more than a day, they will get picked up in four or five hours.\" That view was echoed by a smuggler, now in detention in Tripoli, who the authorities described as a big fish. \"The operation saves life,\" he told the BBC, \"and encourages people to travel more.\" But the IOM argues that with or without Operation Sophia, migrants and refugees will try to reach Europe. \"I can understand what the Libyans are saying about a pull factor, but people will always find ways,\" said its spokesman Itayi Viriri. \"We shudder to imagine what the situation would be like without a concerned rescue effort. The issue of saving lives is paramount.\" Those saved by the Libyan coastguard wind up in detention centres like Abu Salim, on the outskirts of Tripoli. Hundreds are trapped here in what amounts to an airless mini-prison, women and children among them. The youngest detainee we saw was a 21-day-old baby called Mahmud. Many of those we met there were economic migrants, like a 14-year old from The Gambia, in a red and white striped hat. He said he had travelled to Libya alone in the hope of crossing to Europe and finding a job. \"I come from a poor family. I wanted to get to Italy, so I can feed my family. They have not heard from me for two months. They will think I am dead,\" he added. His countryman Abdul Jayie, who is 18, told us the detainees were kept inside for a month at a time. \"Sometimes there are 200-300 people.  We all share two toilets. I feel shame at being a prisoner. I want to go home.\" The authorities say they are doing their best, with scarce resources, at a time when Libya is barely afloat. \"The [food] supplier to our camp gets his money from the state, and he hasn't been paid for a year,\" said Ramadan Rais, the head of Abu Salim. Many of the detainees are visibly desperate to be released. That only happens if they agree to be deported, like the 160 Gambian men who left the centre recently. \"Going back home will be like going to paradise,\" one man said as he queued for a bus. \"I want to see my mother.\" Back on the seashore, Betty is barefoot, with the waves lapping at her feet. \"I am not afraid,\" she said. \"My mind is strong because I believe in God. Every time I look at the sea I say to the water: 'You are not my limit.

{"article": "One manufacturer is even offering a smart water bottle. Lifefuels won an award at the tech show for the bottle with \"five interchangeable \"fuelpods\" filled with vitamins, nutritional products and flavours, allowing users to tailor their water to suit their specific lifestyles\". Why anyone would need such a product is open to debate but it does raise the question about what \"smart\" really means. For many firms, a so-called smart device is just something connected to the internet but Adam Simon, an analyst with research firm Context, thinks it should be about more. \"The real question is  - what can you do with it? What is it actually doing to help you in your life?\" A Context study found most European home-owners are still reluctant to invest in smart tech - 19% of Britons said that they would buy one smart gadget in the next year and, even then, it would have to cost no more than \u00c2\u00a3150. The BBC has been looking at some of the smart tech on offer for the family home at CES. This may just be the craziest thing to come out of CES but it was taken seriously enough by a panel of expert judges to win the CES Launchit ShowStoppers award. Described by founder Leo Trottier as a games console for dogs, the Cleverpet gadget consists of three flashing lights and a treat dispenser. The dog has to press the lights in the right combination in order to win the treat. It also has a microphone and speaker so that pet owners can task their dogs with more complex games - such as touching a particular colour or combination of lights. \"A dog with a job is a happy dog,\" said Mr Trottier as part of his pitch to the judges. \"And my user-base quite literally has nothing else to do.\" He knows a thing or two about training animals - he told the BBC that he taught his cat to use the toilet. More seriously, there are hundreds of pets left home alone each day and Mr Trottier is keen to find a solution to the suggestion that many of these animals are bored. He believes that some dogs will learn to advance to complex levels. There is some serious science behind the design - one member of the team is a neuroscientist who has spent years teaching grammar to birds - and Mr Trottier himself is a cognitive scientist. A little black and white dog named Fiona demoed the system for me, but she could only handle the one button level as she has only been training for a week. Ok, this falls very much into the same category as the smart water bottle as something that is only tenuously smart, and it costs more than \u00c2\u00a3150 - retailing in the US for $400 - but, come on, it's a cocktail maker for your home. Bartesian looks a lot like a capsule-based coffee maker and it is basically the alcoholic equivalent. There are reservoirs for the spirits - vodka, rum, tequila and gin - and these must be supplied by the owner. The rest - including the liqueurs which are recreated using non-alcoholic flavours - comes in a capsule. There are six on offer - including margarita, cosmopolitan and zest martini - and each comes with a barcode that is read by the machine making it. The smart home survey from Context revealed that people regard their kitchen as the smartest room in the house, which is a strange choice given that most living rooms now boast a smart TV - but there are plenty of gadgets on show that aim to add to its smartness. Whirlpool has a dishwasher that can be linked to a Nest thermostat, meaning it will run when energy costs are lowest. And there has been quite a lot of buzz around an internet-connected washing machine which is also packed with sensors, designed by a firm called Marathon Laundry. British firm Smarter, makers of the iKettle, has a range of products on show at CES that are considerably cheaper - all under \u00c2\u00a3100. They include a smart camera for the fridge which takes real-time photos of your food, and a smart mat for cupboards that reveals what ingredients are in there via an app on a smartphone. We all probably use more water than we need so the idea of a shower that will flash when you have used too much is rather compelling. French firm Start & Blue has developed Hydrao, a system that can be fitted to any shower and which flashes red once a 50 litre limit has passed. The company has already sold around 1,000 units and claims that water use was reduced by an average of 25% when it was used. This one's for the kids and could help parents with that perennial problem of getting them away from their screens. Gemio, a venture-funded, Seattle-based firm, has set out to create a wearable for teenagers that it hopes will appeal to both their desire to express themselves and be sociable. \"The challenge with wearables is getting people to wear it beyond a few months,\" Gemio founder Michael Bettua told the BBC. To counter that, the smart bracelets comes with 35 different designs which clip on and off. Wearers can also design their own. They are also fitted with 22 LED lights which can be used to engage with friends who also own bracelets. The bracelet can flash up different light combinations that correlate to customised messages. \"It is a new form of social networking - kids can send secret messages to each other,\" said Mr Bettua. The bracelet goes on sale in June at a price of $85.

PHE said it was the second period in a row \"with exceptionally high numbers\". Scarlet fever commonly affects young children. Parents should look out for signs of a sore throat, headache, fever and pinkish rash on the chest. The rash, which appears within a day or two, can spread to other parts of the body.

{"article": "Dan Coats also told a Senate panel he did not think it was \"appropriate\" to discuss his conversations with the president at a public hearing. His comments follow a report that President Donald Trump asked him to derail the Russia investigation. The National Security Agency chief also declined to comment on the matter. Admiral Mike Rogers told a Senate intelligence committee on Wednesday he has never \"been directed to do anything illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate\" as NSA director. Mr Coats echoed Mr Rogers' statements as senators pressed the pair on their interactions with the president. \"I'm willing to come before the committee and tell you what I know and don't know,\" he said. \"What I'm not willing to do is share information I think ought to be protected in an opening hearing,\" Mr Coats told the panel. He is later appearing in a closed session before the committee on Wednesday afternoon. This Senate testimony by intelligence community heads was billed as the undercard to James Comey's appearance on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but it turned out to be a big letdown. Top intelligence officials in the US government have taken a bunker mentality when it comes to the investigation into Russian meddling in the US election, refusing to share details of presidential conversations in open Senate testimony. Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation, it seems, has the spooks spooked. That may come as a relief to a White House that has been buffeted by a seemingly never-ending stream of controversial revelations, from allegations that the president attempted to influence the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to reports of internal divisions within the administration. The president and his aides shouldn't breath easy, however. Although today's testimony was largely a dud, Mr Comey - no longer a government employee, thanks to Mr Trump - will have more leeway to discuss his interactions with the president if he so chooses. His former colleagues my have seen discretion as the better part of valour, but the former director isn't known for backing down from a fight. Mr Coats testimony comes a day after the Washington Post reported that he told associates Mr Trump had tried to persuade the FBI to back off their investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his ties to the Kremlin. US intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as \"fake news\". The two intelligence chiefs joined acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to testify before the panel on Wednesday. The lack of answers appeared to frustrate both Democratic and Republican senators, who repeatedly pressed the intelligence officials on the Russia inquiry. Republican Senator Richard Burr, who chairs the committee, ended the hearing by appearing to rebuke the intelligence officials for their testimony. \"At no time should you be in a position where you come to Congress without an answer,\" he said. The following day will see the much-anticipated testimony of Mr Comey, who was leading one of the Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him. He will be quizzed on his interactions with the president before he was sacked. Mr Comey reportedly told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with the president. The conversation occurred the day after the president asked Mr Comey to end the investigation into Mr Flynn during a private dinner, according to the New York Times.

{"article": "VR firms such as Oculus and Samsung have concentrated on developing headsets for use at home. But the Void will open its first entertainment centre in Utah in the autumn. One expert said the idea of a physical VR park seemed \"pretty compelling\". The Void's founder Curtis Hickman wants to open virtual reality parks in \"cities all around the world\". \"The Void is about creating the most immersive technology, so instead of sitting at your desk, you walk around an environment. It is a tangible world that seems like it never ends,\" he told the BBC. \"People like to feel that they are somewhere else, and feel the mist in a cave or the heat from a fire - or believe that they are going up in an elevator.\" That experience is creating using haptic vests and a backpack alongside the more familiar VR headset. The version at TED was a bespoke creation that challenged players to solve puzzles as they walked around an ancient tomb. I have tried a few VR headsets in my time but generally I am very aware that, despite the amazing visions I can see through the goggles, I am basically standing in a room moving my head around in an odd fashion. Entering the Void was a very different experience and felt like I had finally fulfilled my childhood dream of stepping inside the TV. There are walls to touch and a stone throne that you are invited to sit on. It all takes place in a small room but the space feels much larger, with corridors that lead to jungles and pools full of sea monsters. You have to pick up virtual torches and when walls crumble you believe that the bricks are falling on you. Despite believing entirely in the world I entered - and feeling like Indiana Jones - I didn't scream when I met a monster or fall down a pit having failed to solve the problem correctly. This was partly because I experienced the Void with a partner, who I rather feebly suggested went first around every corner.. But it was also because I remained aware at all times that this wasn't \"real\". Had I remained there longer than the 10 minutes it took to complete - and I could happily have stayed inside for hours - I may have started to believe more deeply in my strange new reality. Coming back to a somewhat grey Vancouver was a bit disappointing and made me wonder about how we are going to cope with reality when such exciting worlds are just a headset away. The entertainment centres being planned by the Void will offer a range of content and will be family friendly. Ina Fried, a journalist for technology website Recode, enjoyed her test run. \"It was a little rough around the edges but still fun and very immersive,\" she told the BBC. \"It does allow people to get their first taste of VR without having to plunk down cash to buy new gadgets.\" Chris Savage, chief executive of video hosting platform Wistia said: \"I've not experienced it myself but it sounds like laser tag taken to the millionth degree.\" \"The challenge will be to build different physical spaces to experience it in,\" he added. As virtual reality becomes ubiquitous, he thinks the Void raises questions about how people will react to an alternative reality. \"Is it too real for some people? Do you forget you are a person if your avatar is too real?\" Curtis Hickman joked that, while there was a place for the real world, he preferred the Void. \"I know when I get out I want to go straight back in - it's an adventure that is difficult to have any other way,\" he said. He added, on a more serious note, that he hoped the virtual world \"would translate into the real world and help people to live their lives even better\".

The State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report said \"business as usual\" would leave millions at risk from hunger. Last year, nations adopted a UN goal of ending hunger by 2030. \"The climate is changing, so agriculture must change too,\" explained Rob Voss, director of FAO's Agricultural Development Economics division. \"We are saying that because agriculture is already very affected by the impacts of climate change, particularly the countries in the tropical zones. \"Also, agriculture is contributing itself to about one fifth of the global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,\" Mr Voss, who headed the team that produced the FAO State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report, added. \"If we continue along the present pathways then we will not be able to [deliver] food security around the world and we will not be able to stabilise the climate.\" As a result, he told BBC News, there was a need for \"major changes\" to take place in the sector. \"One of the challenges is agriculture itself. As soon as we shovel the ground then we are already releasing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, as it is so dependent on water and quality of land, any impact from the change in climate has a direct impact.\" Therefore, he said, the challenge was bearing these changes in mind and looking at ways to shift to a more sustainable footing. \"A lot of the technologies that are available that allow us to do things differently do face a number of hurdles, especially when it comes to smallholder farmers in developing countries.' These include the cost of changing the way farmers produce their food; knowledge of shifting to the novel ways of farming; urbanisation; access to water. In terms of making the change to deliver a robust global food system, Mr Voss said the report highlighted four steps that could be taken: \"First, put in the steps that would help farmers switch to more sustainable practices, such as more efficient use of fertilizers and using heat tolerant and drought resistant crop varieties.\" He added that management systems, such as agroforestry - which places forestry cultivation around farmlands, would also be beneficial as it helps farmers build in great resilience against the impacts of climate change. \"Secondly, we need to work harder to increase the capacity of soils and forestry to sequestrate carbon. Deforestation and changes to land-use is one of the major sources of emissions from the sector. \"A third area where we can immediately start work on is to reduce food losses and waste. We estimate that about one third of the food we produce gets lost in the post-harvest process or gets wasted at the consumer end. \"The fourth area, which is more challenging, is to try and do something about people's diets. What we have been seeing around the world is a clear shift towards increasing demands for food products that put a lot more pressure on natural resources.\" The report observed: \"Rebalancing diets towards less animal-sourced foods would make an important contribution in this direction, with probable co-benefits for human health.\" FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva said that the coming twelve months should be about \"putting commitments into action\", referring to the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goal of delivering \"zero hunger\" by 2030. He also observed that agriculture was set to be one of the main topics for discussion at the forthcoming UN climate summit in Morocco in November. \"Climate change threatens all dimensions of food security,\" Mr Graziano da Silva warned. \"It will expose both urban and rural poor to higher and more volatile food prices. It will also affect food availability by reducing the productivity of crops, livestock and fisheries.\" He stated: \"Hunger, poverty and climate change need to be tackled together.\" Follow Mark on Twitter.", "question": "The global farming sector has a big role to play in the effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and @placeholder to future climate change , the UN says .", "option_0": "race", "option_1": "adapting", "option_2": "appears", "option_3": "devoted", "option_4": "lead", "label": 1}

He spoke out after the Manchester Evening News revealed a man who died in a van fire was living in the vehicle. Homelessness charity The Wellspring, in Stockport, said the man worked in the building industry and had been in the process of trying to find a home. Mr Brobbey, 50, said: \"I had too much dignity to ask for help. Now I want to help others.\" Originally from Ancoats, Manchester, he said a break-up in 2012 left him with \"no choice\" but to leave his home, and financial problems made matters worse. \"To cut a long story short I just didn't have anywhere to go,\" he said.

{"article": "A team from Cardiff University has spent the last month excavating Caerau hill fort near Ely. It is smaller than its contemporaries at Pentyrch and Pontprennau and had been thought to be inferior in status. But structures and artefacts so far unearthed suggest the fort remained important well into the Roman era. Until now it has been thought that the fort was purely a stronghold of the Silurian tribe who inhabited this part of Wales from around the 5th Century BC, falling into disuse once they were finally defeated by the Romans, circa 75 AD. However the initial dig this summer has uncovered a considerable amount of new information, including three Iron Age roundhouses and a stone-built pathway that runs around the edge of the hill fort, suggesting to the experts a possible domestic and/or political dimension. Also, the mix of Silurian and Roman artefacts may indicate that the fort was occupied much later than had been thought, and that the two groups might have mingled there. Dr Oliver Davis, from the university's School of History, Archaeology and Religion, said: \"People think of these sites as defensive structures, but our attention is turning to whether the people who lived there were actually developing a community or collective identity for themselves. \"Our community excavations show that occupation at the site continued until at least the third century AD, well into the Roman period. \"Domestic life is indicated by the discovery of simple tools and ceramics from all periods. \"A glimpse of the personality of the inhabitants is provided by the discovery of a glass bead of Iron Age date and an enamelled disc brooch of Roman date. \"Both these objects indicate that individuals were concerned with their appearance, and that life in the past was a little more colourful than we sometimes think. \"Over the past month the team has also examined the inner of the three ramparts that surround the hill fort. These ramparts and their associated ditches were unlikely to have been built just for defence.\" But as well as colour from the past, Dave Horton, of the community organisation Action in Caerau and Ely, said the way local residents have had a hand in the discoveries has also lent a little colour to the present. \"The last few weeks have seen a whirlwind of activity in Ely and Caerau focused around our beautiful iron-age hill fort,\" he said. \"Literally hundreds of local people have visited the site and have dug together, learned new skills, shared local knowledge, and have celebrated together with a fantastic Iron Age hog roast.\" \"We have all walked down the hill to our homes with a different perspective.

{"article": "The previously secret justice department memo was published after a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and The New York Times. Anwar al Awlaki was killed by a US drone attack in Yemen in 2011. Critics have said Awlaki was killed without being given his right to legal due process as an American citizen. The memo argues the killing was legal because he was an \"operational leader\" of an \"enemy force\" at war with the US. Analysis - Aleem Maqbool, Washington DC The justification of the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki under the established laws of armed conflict focuses on the view he posed the imminent threat of a violent attack against the US. He had been linked to numerous plots to kill Americans, including the shootings at a military base in Texas in 2009 in which 13 people died. However there are legal experts who dispute the claim that Awlaki was beyond capture, and others who question whether the rules of \"war\" can be applied to the fight against militants around the world, including Yemen. Even for those who accept the rationale for Anwar al-Awlaki's extrajudicial killing in 2011, it is harder to justify the apparently inadvertent deaths of two other American citizens killed in drone attacks around the same time, including Awlaki's 16-year-old son. Jameel Jaffer, an ACLU lawyer who argued the case, said the memo's release \"represents an overdue but nonetheless crucial step towards transparency\". \"There are few questions more important than the question of when the government has the authority to kill its own citizens.\" The document, still partially redacted, also says the killing of Awlaki by US military forces would be legal under an authorisation for the use of US force after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington DC. It is dated July 2010, more than a year before Awlaki was killed. Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American Muslim cleric of Yemeni descent, was linked to a series of attacks and plots across the world - including the 9/11 attacks and the shootings at Fort Hood in November 2009. Awlaki was born in 1971 in the southern US state of New Mexico, where his father, Nasser, a future Yemeni agriculture minister and university president, was studying agricultural economics. He lived in the US until the age of seven, when his family returned to Yemen. He returned again for more than a decade to study and work, but left in 2002. His family mounted a legal challenge after he was put on a US \"kill list\", authorising his death by the CIA, in order to stop the execution of one of its citizens without any judicial process.", "question": "A New York court has released the Obama administration 's legal justification for the killing of a US citizen and @placeholder al - Qaeda leader in Yemen .", "option_0": "suspected", "option_1": "targeted", "option_2": "twisted", "option_3": "buried", "option_4": "wounded", "label": 0}
{"article": "UK scientists say they were \"amazed\" to find an example of such a sophisticated arithmetic calculation in biology. Mathematical models show that the amount of starch consumed overnight is calculated by division in a process involving leaf chemicals, a John Innes Centre team reports in e-Life journal. Birds may use similar methods to preserve fat levels during migration. The scientists studied the plant Arabidopsis, which is regarded as a model plant for experiments. Overnight, when the plant cannot use energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into sugars and starch, it must regulate its starch reserves to ensure they last until dawn. Experiments by scientists at the John Innes Centre, Norwich, show that to adjust its starch consumption so precisely, the plant must be performing a mathematical calculation - arithmetic division. \"They're actually doing maths in a simple, chemical way - that's amazing, it astonished us as scientists to see that,\" study leader Prof Alison Smith told BBC News. \"This is pre-GCSE maths they're doing, but they're doing maths.\" The scientists used mathematical modelling to investigate how a division calculation can be carried out inside a plant. During the night, mechanisms inside the leaf measure the size of the starch store. Information about time comes from an internal clock, similar to the human body clock. The researchers proposed that the process is mediated by the concentrations of two kinds of molecules called \"S\" for starch and \"T\" for time. If the S molecules stimulate starch breakdown, while the T molecules prevent this from happening, then the rate of starch consumption is set by the ratio of S molecules to T molecules. In other words, S divided by T. \"This is the first concrete example in biology of such a sophisticated arithmetic calculation,\" said mathematical modeller Prof Martin Howard, of the John Innes Centre. The scientists think similar mechanisms may operate in animals such as birds to control fat reserves during migration over long distances, or when they are deprived of food when incubating eggs. Commenting on the research, Dr Richard Buggs of Queen Mary, University of London, said: \"This is not evidence for plant intelligence. It simply suggests that plants have a mechanism designed to automatically regulate how fast they burn carbohydrates at night.

North Carolina recently passed a bill that revokes protections for LGBT people and requires transgender individuals to use restrooms based on their biological gender identity. Major companies and CEOs signed on to a letter urging North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to repeal the law. Tech company PayPal has withdrawn its plan to open an operations centre, which would have employed 400 people, over the law. The governor of Georgia rejected a similar bill after pressure from major companies that do business in the state. States have been drawing up religious freedom laws, largely under pressure from religious groups, in response to the US Supreme Court ruling last summer legalising gay marriage. The intention of the Mississippi bill, the \"Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act,\" is to protect people who think marriage is between one man and one woman, that sexual relations should only happen in marriages and that gender is not changeable.

{"article": "John Cridland, director general of the employers' group, says England's exam system is narrow and out of date. He proposes a system in which the most important exams would be A-levels, including both academic and vocational subjects, taken at the age of 18. Ministers are pushing for all pupils to take a core group of academic GCSEs. \"By the end of this parliament, I want to see the date for the last GCSEs circled in the secretary of state's diary,\" said Mr Cridland, who warns of a \"false choice\" between academic and vocational lessons. In a speech at the annual Festival of Education at Wellington College, Mr Cridland will set out an employers' blueprint for improving schools. He says that for too long \"we've just pretended\" to have an exam system that values vocational education, when in practice, exams have operated as stepping stones towards a university degree. Mr Cridland argues that GCSEs have been made an irrelevance when pupils stay in education or training until the age of 18. In having such major exams at the age of 16, he says: \"We have to face the uncomfortable truth that - internationally - we're the oddballs.\" \"GCSEs are past their sell-by date and should be retired.\" He says that the only purpose they serve now is to allow measurement of schools through league tables. The proposal to scrap GCSEs comes as ministers are pushing for an even greater emphasis on academic GCSEs, with plans for all pupils to have to take core academic subjects. This announcement \"misses the point that we need curriculum reform, not just exam reform\", says the CBI chief. \"The government must make a start on a full review of 14-to-18 education by the end of the summer.\" Mr Cridland describes the current vocational education as a \"restricted, unloved range of options\" and \"a social and economic own goal\". \"Non-academic routes should be rigorous and different to academic ones, but not second best.\" The lack of a strong vocational education at the moment means that many pupils are poorly served, he says, as not all children are suited to a narrowly academic approach. For employers, it can mean that they have to carry out \"remedial\" work with young recruits to get them ready for the workplace. From the perspective of employers, he says the school system needs to teach skills beyond academic lessons, such as character and resilience. \"Debates about schools structure and exam reform are sterile if they aren't linked to outcomes for young people. And that is a missing link in our system.\" He also called for an Ofsted system that recognises innovation, rather than an excessive focus on data. \"Rebel head teachers succeed in spite of the system, not because of it,\" he says. Mr Cridland also wants more engagement from business in education. The lack of good quality careers education remains a major problem, he says, and he argues that businesses should play a bigger part in making links between school and employment. \"Schools shouldn't be places where businesspeople drop their kids at the beginning of the day like they drop off their dry-cleaning,\" he says. The Department for Education said: \"A rigorous academic curriculum until age 16 is the best way to ensure that every child succeeds, regardless of their background, and allows us to be ambitious for everyone, to keep options open and horizons broad.\" A department spokeswoman said A-levels had been reformed \"to ensure they are equipping young people with the skills and knowledge for higher education and the world of work\".", "question": "The head of the CBI says a date must be set in the next five years to scrap GCSEs and introduce an exam system with equal @placeholder for vocational subjects .", "option_0": "advice", "option_1": "success", "option_2": "support", "option_3": "status", "option_4": "validity", "label": 3}

He spent five months there, and on 18 April, he boarded a boat to Europe. The accident happened on 19 April. I heard he was in the hospital or with the Red Cross. But on 11 June, I was told my husband had drowned.\" Mrs Sanogo shows pictures of their wedding and of the baptism of their three children, emphasizing the fact that she had not wanted her husband to leave his job delivering bread. \"I told him that I did not want him to go because I would much rather have my husband close to me,\" she said. \"I told him that even if we did not have a lot, he was earning some money and that I was not asking for much. But he insisted that he wanted to give us a better life, and not depend on anyone, and also provide for his sick father.\" Throughout Tambacounda, scores of people tell a similar story - a husband, father or brother who died trying to reach Europe illegally. Here, many travel agencies offer bus tickets to neighbouring countries. From Tambacounda, most migrants go to Mali, and from there to Burkina Faso and then to Niger's northern town of Agadez, from where they travel across the Sahara desert into Libya. It is the last stop on land before people smugglers put them on boats towards Italy. But many are unprepared for what happens on the way, says Aliou Mbow, 23: \"Travelling conditions are so hard, even to get to Libya. \"You can get hit and sometimes people even get killed. For example, if there is an accident, or you fall from the truck in the desert and break your leg, the driver can pull out a gun and eliminate you, and then we keep on going. Nobody dares to ask for anything.\" Mr Mbow made it to Libya but then there was some trouble on the boat to Italy. His group was lucky enough to be able to sail back to Libya. He decided it was not worth risking his life again so he went back to Senegal. Some local media have reported that in Senegal, the Tambacounda region has had the highest number of deaths since April due to illegal migration. \"Even after what happened in April, there are still people leaving,\" says Harouna Cisse, a teacher who has not had any news from his brother since he went on the perilous journey. \"Each day some young people take the trip, each and every day. This is because of unemployment.  There is nothing here in Tambacounda, no infrastructure, and the government just keeps on making promises.\" Expressing a similar view, Ibrahima Traore, the head of a youth group in Tambacounda, says: \"Even if you graduate from a training programme you find no real economic prospect, no company to offer jobs here.\" \"Illegal migration is not a new phenomenon, but it is on the rise these past few years. And the government is just standing idly by.\" There are still no statistics to evaluate the scale of the problem in a region where the official unemployment rate in 2013 stood at 36.5%, though some analysts say it is likely to be lower because it fails to take into account jobs in the informal sector. Bassirou Fall is a regional official from the ministry of youth. He cannot say how many have left or how many have died. He just knows how many made it back alive - 75 young men have been repatriated since the beginning of the year. He admits the crisis is partly caused by \"numerous failures in employment public policies\". \"The profiles of returnees are young people from rural areas that were unemployed, or poor farmers,\" he says. \"According to their testimonies it is because they could not bear to see their parents struggle to provide for the family that they resorted to illegal migration. So we want to help them return to agriculture. We want to start vast and well-equipped farming structures to allow young people to work in them.\" No-one knows exactly when those new farms will be set up. In the meantime, nothing is done for families who have lost their breadwinners to illegal migration. Each day, the widowed Mrs Sanogo bathes her children in a small bucket in front of her house. She does not expect much from the government. The mother of three relies only on help from her poor family. She could not prevent her husband from leaving but she has promised herself one thing:  the only way one of her sons will travel to Europe will be on a plane, with a valid visa.", "question": "People in one of Senegal 's poorest areas are in mourning after dozens of their loved ones lost their lives in shipwrecks off the Libyan coast as they tried to make the treacherous journey to Europe .

{"article": "Forces under his command have seized control of Libya's main oil terminals, handing the key to the country's crucial oil exports to his ally - the elected parliament based in the eastern city of Tobruk. Born in 1943 in the eastern town of Ajadbiya, Haftar was one of the group of officers led by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi which seized power from King Idris in 1969. Gaddafi put Haftar - recently promoted to field marshal - in charge of the Libyan forces involved in the conflict in Chad in the 1980s. This proved to be his downfall, as Libya was defeated by the French-backed Chadian forces, and Haftar and 300 of his men were captured by the Chadians in 1987. Having previously denied the presence of Libyan troops in the country, Gaddafi disowned him. This led Haftar to devote the next two decades towards toppling the Libyan leader. He did this from exile in the US state of Virginia. His proximity to the CIA's headquarters in Langley hinted at a close relationship with US intelligence services, who gave their backing to several attempts to assassinate Gaddafi. After the start of the uprising against Gaddafi in 2011, Haftar returned to Libya where he became a key commander of the makeshift rebel force in the east. With Gaddafi's downfall, Haftar faded into obscurity until February 2014, when he outlined on TV his plan to save the nation and called on Libyans to rise up against the elected parliament, the General National Congress (GNC), whose mandate was still valid at the time. His dramatic announcement was made at a time when Libya's second city, Benghazi, and other towns in the east had in effect been taken over by the local al-Qaeda affiliate, Ansar al-Sharia, and other Islamist groups who mounted a campaign of assassinations and bombings targeting the military, police personnel and other public servants. Although Haftar did not have the wherewithal to put his plan into action, his announcement reflected popular sentiment, especially in Benghazi, which had become disenchanted with the total failure of the GNC and its government to confront the Islamists. Haftar's popularity is not necessarily shared elsewhere in the country where he is remembered more for his past association with Gaddafi and his subsequent US connections. He is also detested by Islamists who resent him for confronting them in Benghazi and elsewhere in the east. In May 2014 Haftar launched Operation Dignity against Islamist militants in Benghazi and the east. In March 2015 Libya's elected parliament, the House of Representatives (HoR) - which had replaced the GNC - appointed him commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA). After a year of little progress, in February 2016 the LNA pushed the Islamist militants out of much of Benghazi. By mid-April this had been followed up by further military action that dislodged the Islamists from their strongholds outside Benghazi and as far as Derna, 250km east of Benghazi. In September 2016, the LNA launched operation \"Swift Thunder\", seizing from the Petroleum Facilities Guard - an armed group aligned with the UN-brokered Government of National Accord (GNA) - the key oil terminals of Zueitina, Brega, Ras Lanuf and Sidrah, in the oil-rich heartland locally known as the Oil Cresent. In recognition of this, the Speaker of the HoR and supreme commander of the armed forces, Agilah Saleh, promoted Haftar from lieutenant-general to field marshal. Haftar is reported to be unhappy with the line-up of the GNA, which has allocated the defence portfolio to another officer, Ibrahim al-Barghathi. And he is suspicious of the GNA's reliance on the mainly Misrata-based militias, which include some Islamist elements. The Skhirat agreement of December 2015, which laid the foundation for the national unity government, stipulated that the HoR meet within one month of the proposed unity government to consider whether to grant it a vote of confidence. However, after several attempts the HoR, has failed to attain the necessary quorum to vote on the proposed cabinet. According to media reports, proponents of the unity government within the HoR blame this on Haftar, who is said to have persuaded his supporters among the deputies to deprive the legislature of the necessary number of attendants. Haftar insists that he will abide by any decision taken by the HoR. While he has been ambiguous about his own political ambition, it is likely that this is confined to a key role for himself in the new army under the national unity government and, more generally, for the LNA in the new armed forces.

{"article": "The two-day extension was granted after the government website for registering voters failed just before Tuesday's original deadline. A prominent Leave campaigner has said he is considering launching a legal challenge to that decision. Leave.EU founder Arron Banks said there were grounds for a judicial review of the \"unconstitutional\" move. The government had pushed through emergency legislation to allow people to register until 23:59 BST on Thursday. The extension to the deadline covered everywhere apart from Northern Ireland, where the online system was not in use. The referendum on whether or not the UK remains in the EU will be held on 23 June. Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin said in the hour leading up to the crash that there had been 214,000 registration applications. Tuesday's rise was \"three times as intense a spike as occurred before the general election\" he said, and it would have taken a spike \"six times as large\" to cause the site to fail again, he told MPs. According to the official government website, there were 242,000 applications to register to vote on Wednesday, the second highest total since mid-May when a registration campaign was launched. Of these, 135,600 were from people aged under 35. There were a further 195,000 applications on Thursday, taking the overall two-day total to 437,000 applications. The proportion of applications coming from younger age groups continued to be very high, as it was in the days before the deadline - 77% of those applying were from the youngest three age groups, meaning they were under 45. Mr Banks, an insurance millionaire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday: \"We've got lawyers that are looking at [the extension] at the moment. \"They are tending to say it's unconstitutional because once you've set the rules you can't really change it halfway through, and Parliament really shouldn't be doing this.\" BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said many Leave campaigners saw the deadline extension as a \"fix\" because they think people who signed up late will be younger and therefore more likely to support the EU. The official leave campaign - Vote Leave, in which Mr Banks plays no part - has said the government was trying to register as many likely Remain voters as possible, but stopped short of suggesting that it would consult lawyers.", "question": "More than 430,000 people applied to register to vote in the EU referendum during the @placeholder deadline period .", "option_0": "voting", "option_1": "planned", "option_2": "extended", "option_3": "race", "option_4": "initial", "label": 2}
{"article": "This guy that they'd known for his fearsome reputation as one of national hunt racing's hardest, and most difficult opponents to beat, was now motionless from the neck down, and struggling at times to breathe let alone speak. But, remarkably, McNamara and his wife Caroline refused to be downcast, preferring to confront their plight head-on, politely asking visitors to take any tears they might care to shed outside the room. It was that attitude of bloody-minded determination not to give in - AP McCoy had a tone of awe in his voice, I thought, when describing his friend on BBC radio as \"very mentally strong\" - that made him such an inspiration to so many. And, my goodness, strength of extraordinary quantities was needed after the winner of Cheltenham Festival trophies and holder of point-to-pointing records was so cruelly propelled from saddle to 24-hour care that March afternoon in 2013. Miraculously, when you consider the gloomy prognosis as the air ambulance took him away from the racecourse, he eventually got home to County Limerick, the area of his birth, to a specially-designed bungalow, and started working with a small number of horses and even making occasional trips to the races. His changing room colleagues have, of course, felt it all most keenly, in the knowledge that this fate could so easily have befallen them; horses fall in jump races every day of every week, and an inch here or an inch there can make all the difference in terms of walking away or not. But in addition, McNamara's story resonated across the racing world and on to the wider public probably to a large extent because of its poignancy. When Galaxy Rock fell, at the first fence, in the Festival's Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Chase, the then 37-year-old was considered to still be very much at the top of his game, and memories of great days and celebrations with Cheltenham winners like the prolific Spotthedifference and Teaforthree were fresh in the memory. Although he'd never turned professional, the principal reason had nothing to do with ability, but, crucially, that amateur status allowed him to remain a big riding fish on Ireland's renowned point-to-pointing circuit, something of a show window for potential buyers. So, he was, as they say, going well, but he'd also spoken to friends about the possibility of retiring in the not too distant future; heartbreakingly, the decision was never his to make. And then last year, in a barely believable twist, his first cousin Robbie McNamara was confined to a wheelchair by a fall, in Ireland, on the eve of the Grand National at Aintree in which he was due to take part. Happily, Robbie has recovered enough to be training and, to considerable all-round pleasure, saddled his first winners in July to create some rays of light in what has otherwise been a desperately sad series of events. The story of JT McNamara will, however, never be forgotten: memories of his rampant success in the saddle won't allow that, nor will his extraordinary courage in the face of adversity.

{"article": "It is easy to dismiss Tuesday's lengthy (8 hours, 24 minutes) meeting of Labour's national executive committee as a festival of navel-gazing, but there is a lot more at stake. The idea that Wales should have its own seat on the NEC has been around for some time. Alun Michael used it as part of his Welsh Labour leadership campaign in 1988. It will now happen, but only after a close vote and a long debate over how the Welsh representative should be chosen. He or she will now be a \"frontbench\" member of the Welsh Assembly, chosen by the party leader in Wales. (Carwyn Jones can currently attend NEC meetings but has no voting rights). The vote was close - 16 to 15 - because supporters of Jeremy Corbyn thought it better that the Welsh rep be chosen by rank-and-file members who might be more in tune with his philosophy than someone chosen by the Welsh party leadership. Welsh Labour will also now take responsibility for its own elections, so the electoral college is likely to survive. One member one vote, with supporters able to pay to take part, is widely seen as key to the election of Jeremy Corbyn and few in the Welsh Labour hierarchy want to repeat the experiment when Carwyn Jones moves on. The leader of Welsh Labour will also get the right to attend \"Clause V\" meetings, where the Labour general election manifesto is signed off. And the Welsh executive will \"administer the procedure and selection of Westminster parliamentary candidates in Wales\". It's not clear whether that includes by-elections, where candidates have often been shortlisted by the NEC. But it could be significant with proposed boundary changes likely to mean some sitting Labour MPs going head-to-head for their own job. Some MPs fear that Corbyn supporters will try to deselect them before the next election in what they would describe as a purge and others see as wider democracy in constituencies with growing memberships under the current leader. Again, it's unclear whether devolving powers to Cardiff would have any impact. The changes add up to a more federal structure within Labour and \"parity\" with Scottish Labour, although its leader, Kezia Dugdale, says it will now have the power to make policy in reserved (i.e. not devolved) areas too. In other news, the polls have closed in the Labour leadership election, with Owen Smith doing little to fuel optimism among his supporters that he might win:   \"I won't be serving in Jeremy's cabinet but I will do what I've always done which is be Labour, vote Labour loyally serve this party, make sure that from back benches I continue to make the arguments I've made during this campaign.\" The election result will be declared on Saturday ahead of the Labour conference in Liverpool, where the changes to Labour's internal machinery are expected to be approved by delegates.", "question": "As a political anorak , I @placeholder to few in my fascination with the internal rulebook of political parties .

{"article": "The agreement would have meant an Orange parade, prevented from returning to Ligoniel on July 12, 2013, would have been completed on Friday morning. A loyalist protest camp at Twaddell Avenue would then have been dismantled. The deal was to be announced on Monday, but a press conference was cancelled. The Crumlin and Ardoyne Residents Association (CARA), the residents group involved in the talks, held a public meeting on Monday night to outline details of the proposed agreement. Afterwards, some of those who attended said they were opposed to the deal, but believe it will go ahead. Members of CARA then held a private meeting to discuss the feedback and agree the next step. A statement is expected to be issued later. It is understood discussions involving loyalists and Orange Order members are also taking place. Sources told the BBC that opinion about the proposal among those at the meeting was divided. Two nationalist MLAs for north Belfast who attended the meeting said they hoped a resolution to the dispute could be found. \"The mood of tonight's meeting is that this could be an extraordinary moment, but people are very, very worried, they want to come to a conclusion,\" said Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in MLA Gerry Kelly. \"CARA outlined proposals that were brought forward by two facilitators, they have given an update about where it is at the moment and they have taken soundings, listened to people. There were many different opinions in there.\" Mr Kelly said CARA now faces a difficult decision and that he will support whatever they decide. SDLP MLA Nicola Mallon said the meeting had been told that one of the three Orange lodges involved in the dispute has said it would not support the proposed agreement. \"Tonight was the first time that many people have had a chance to look at those details and to consider them,\" she said. \"Certainly a lot of people had a lot of questions to  ask and have asked that CARA goes away and reflects on their views and comes back.\" The deal between CARA and the Orange Order also included a moratorium on future parades that pass a contested section of the route past the Ardoyne shop fronts on the Crumlin Road. Under the terms of the deal, CARA would not object to five morning parades by the Orange Order and the Apprentice Boys. In return, the Loyal Orders had agreed not to apply for permission for return evening parades, including on the Twelfth, until agreement could be reached. The agreement would be hugely significant, but it does not have universal support. Another nationalist residents group, the Greater Ardoyne Residents Collective (GARC), has made it clear that it is opposed to the deal. In recent days, members of one of three Orange lodges involved in the parades dispute have not backed the agreement. Ballysillan LOL 1891 has said it would not take part in the parade back to Ligoniel on Friday morning. That caused concern on the nationalist side that any agreement would not stick and that some members of the Orange Order might continue the protest. The loyalist protest at Twaddell Avenue began in July 2013 after a Parades Commission determination not to allow a return leg of an Orange parade to pass a section of the Crumlin road.

He withstood some excellent South Africa bowling, particularly from Vernon Philander, who took 2-17. England gave Test debuts to three players, with Tom Westley making 25 and Dawid Malan one. Pace bowler Toby Roland-Jones is included in a bowling attack that is without left-arm spinner Liam Dawson, who was omitted to make way for an extra batsman. Rain arrived before lunch, during tea and finally, just after 18:00 BST. The four-match series is level at 1-1. Media playback is not supported on this device Following a heavy defeat in the second Test at Trent Bridge, England's batsmen came in for some fierce criticism for a cavalier approach that is often not suited to the longest form of the game. Here, they all looked to apply themselves, with Cook giving a perfect demonstration of the judgement, grit and patience that has made him England's all-time leading run-scorer. The left-hander only played the ball when necessary, often leaving on length, scoring with tickles off the pads and pushes square on the off side. He added 52 with Essex team-mate Westley, 49 with captain Joe Root and an unbeaten 51 with Ben Stokes, who remains on 21. With the match evenly poised, England will look to the former skipper to push on to a 31st Test century and well beyond on Friday. Media playback is not supported on this device What made Cook's knock all the more impressive was the examination provided by the South Africa pace attack on a green-tinged pitch that offered just enough assistance. Philander managed only four overs in the morning session because of a stomach upset, but still had Keaton Jennings caught at third slip for nought. The opener has now made three ducks in nine Test innings. Morne Morkel tormented Root after lunch, but it was Philander who struck, a wonderful delivery matched by the one-handed catch of diving wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. However, it was Kagiso Rabada who produced the moment of the day, a searing inswinging yorker that bowled Malan off his pads. Right-hander Westley, given an opportunity at number three after Gary Ballance broke a finger, was at the crease in only the fourth over and looked at home in Test cricket. Strong off the pads, he followed Cook's example to leave well outside off stump. He fell after lunch, loosely driving at Chris Morris to be caught at third slip. Middlesex's Malan, a left-hander, endured a more difficult day, taking 15 deliveries to get off the mark. But he was in no way to blame for his dismissal, with Rabada's toe-crushing pace virtually unplayable. Media playback is not supported on this device Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS: \"Malan got an 88mph yorker, which is always difficult, but I do think he gets a bit shut off. \"That front foot can just be opened a little bit to get in a better alignment because clearly he is going to get that ball again in the second innings. \"I can't see Jennings opening in Australia this winter but I saw him in Mumbai and thought he could play. \"Clearly he is low in confidence and I don't see him walking out at Brisbane but you never say never.

{"article": "He runs the Hook and Cleaver butcher in Ealing, west London. \"At the time trade really did go through the roof, especially with mince products, burgers, sausages, things like that,\" he says. Consumers had lost confidence in some supermarket products and favoured local butchers like Mr Dzido who could tell them more about the meat they were buying. The scandal emerged in mid-January, when Irish food inspectors announced they had found traces of horsemeat in some frozen beefburgers stocked by UK supermarkets including Tesco, Iceland and Lidl. Over the next few months a number of stores and suppliers across the UK and Europe had to remove products labelled as beef after test results revealed they contained varying quantities of horsemeat - in some cases up to 100%. As a result sales of frozen burgers and frozen ready meals plunged. The most dramatic decline came in March and April of last year when frozen burger sales tumbled 41% compared with the same months in 2012, according to figures from industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel. Frozen ready meals also saw a sharp drop in sales, falling 11% in March and 15% in April. But since that panic the frozen burger has made a comeback. For the 12 weeks to 8 December 2013, burger sales were down just 1% compared with the same period in 2012. The reason? Heavy discounting. Food retailers, including Iceland, discounted burgers after the crisis and shoppers found that hard to resist, particularly at a time when many households were struggling with tighter budgets. \"If something is out there at half price you get huge spikes in sales, people immediately react to that,\" says Ed Garner, communications director at Kantar Worldpanel. However, frozen ready meals have not seen the same kind of recovery. The most recent figures show sales still down 6% compared with a year ago. Analysts say that is probably because shoppers were uncertain about the quality of frozen ready meals, even before the horsemeat scandal broke. \"People were already predisposed to suspect frozen foods were somehow inferior,\" says Mr Garner. \"It kind of confirmed matters when people saw that a frozen ready meal turned out to be all horse and no meat.\" As well as affecting sales, the horsemeat scandal has changed the way some customers shop for food. An Ipsos Mori poll run in partnership with the Grocer magazine shows that almost a third of respondents said the incident had \"permanently impacted\" the way they chose and bought food. And a survey carried out on behalf consumer organisation Which? in late November found that 49% of respondents said the horsemeat incident had changed their shopping habits, with 25% saying they bought less processed meat and 17% saying they bought more products from butchers and farmers' markets. And it seems that value for money is still the main concern for many shoppers. \"Twenty-six per cent of the British public are buying cheaper food than they were a year ago, which may suggest that price is still a central factor in food choices,\" says Stephen Yap, head of Ipsos MarketQuest. According to the Ipsos Mori poll, Tesco and Iceland suffered more damage to their reputations from the incident than other supermarket chains. Ipsos Mori asked if people felt more or less favourable towards the six major UK supermarkets after the incident. In response, 20% of those polled said they felt less favourably about Tesco, and 14% felt less favourably about Iceland. But both chains would probably point to the fact that almost 70% of respondents \"felt the same\" about them. A Tesco spokesperson told the BBC: \"The horsemeat issue impacted customer confidence across the retail industry. In response to the issue, we promised our customers we would make significant changes, and we have done so. \"We take nothing for granted and will continue to work hard to ensure customers know our food is of the highest quality.\" Iceland did not respond to a BBC enquiry. Retailers have been working hard to regain trust, according to industry body the British Retail Consortium: \"Over the last 12 months suppliers have been reassessed, supply chains are less complex including an increase in sourcing from the UK, there has been an increase in the unannounced audits of suppliers, and increased testing of ingredients.\" Back in Ealing, Mr Dzido is proud of the fact that he travels to Smithfield meat market and personally selects the meat sold in his shop. \"We offer a bit more than supermarkets do.

Mississippi's Secretary of State, Delbert Hosemann, a Republican, said in an official statement that his reply to the commission would be \"they can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi is a great state to launch from\". Mr Trump set up the commission to investigate claims - unsubstantiated, but which he repeats - that millions of fraudulent votes cost him the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election. He secured more votes in the all-important electoral college than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, thus winning the presidency. Mr Trump established the Presidential Advisory commission on Election Integrity in May, despite evidence that voter fraud is not a widespread problem in the US. The aim is to \"increase the American people's confidence in the integrity of our election systems\". Kentucky's Secretary of State, Alison Lundergan Grimes, said she would not be releasing \"sensitive personal data to the federal government\". \"Kentucky will not aid a commission that is at best a waste of taxpayer money and at worst an attempt to legitimise voter suppression efforts across the country,\" she said in a statement. The panel, described by Mr Trump as \"very distinguished,\" is chaired by Vice-President Mike Pence. On Wednesday its vice-chair, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, sent a letter to the 50 US states and the District of Columbia requesting details from voter rolls including: names, addresses, dates of birth, political affiliation, last four digits of social security number, voting history since 2006, criminal convictions and military status. The information would be used \"to fully analyse vulnerabilities and issues related to voter registration and voting,\" the letter said. Many other states, including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Alabama have said they will not send the information, or will only send information that is already publically available.

{"article": "In two experiments, teams of researchers managed to attach tracking and sound-recording tags to 17 blue whales and two beaked whales. They then played simulated sonar sound through an underwater speaker and measured the animals' responses. The findings are reported in two Royal Society journals, Proceedings B and Biology Letters. Researchers have previously linked mass strandings and deaths of beaked whales around the world to military exercises using what is known as mid-frequency sonar. So scientists have been keen to understand if the sound harmed the animals. The new study does not explain those strandings - the chain of events that leads to these remains unclear. But marine mammal expert Patrick Miller, from the University of St Andrews' Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU), who was not involved with the new study, said the results showed it would be wise for naval exercises to \"avoid critical habitat areas\". The beaked whale study was led by scientists also from the SMRU. It revealed what researchers had long suspected, that man-made sound had a negative effect on these deep-diving whales. Beaked whales use sound to hunt as well as to communicate. They produce echolocation clicks as they dive up to 1.5km (1mi) in depth, picking up echoes that bounce off the bodies of the squid they are hunting. When the scientists played the sonar sounds during their experiments, both of the tagged Cuvier's beaked whales stopped hunting and \"swam rapidly, silently away\". Perhaps more surprising was that, in the other study, led by Jeremy Goldbogen from the Cascadia Research Collective in the US state of Washington, several blue whales also responded to the sound. Blue whales communicate with very low-frequency sound - far below that of naval sonar. And because they do not use sound to hunt, the scientists thought they would not be affected. Yet the whales' responses did vary. Animals that were feeding close to the surface showed almost no response, but animals that were diving for krill - rather than sifting the surface waters - reacted very differently. \"One animal was diving and feeding repeatedly all throughout the day,\" recalled Dr Goldbogen. \"And as soon as the sound started, the animal stopped feeding and maintained a directed heading and moved away from the sound source.\" These vast animals can scoop up half a million calories' worth of krill in one gulp as they dive, so disturbing their feeding deprives them of large amounts of energy. \"I calculated that in that time, the animal lost a metric tonne of krill,\" said Dr Goldbogen. \"So if this happens a lot in these feeding hotspots, that could have real consequences.\" And currently, naval exercises are carried out in these hotspots. The blue whales in this study, for example, were feeding in the in-shore waters of California during the summer and autumn of 2010. The study area is where the US Navy carries out regular exercises and where the whales come to build up fat stores for the long migration to their breeding grounds. Even subtle disturbance to this vital pre-migration gorge, said Dr Goldbogen, \"could have real consequences for the population health\". \"These are the biggest animals that have ever lived, so they need a huge amount of food,\" he added. The detailed examination of the whales' behaviour was made possible by the technology contained within the tracking tags. See inside a blue whale How do whale species live for 200 years? Hear humpback whale mating calls \"A lot of the same sensors that are in our smartphones are in the tags we attached to these whales,\" said Dr Goldbogen. \"When you rotate your phone and the screen moves with you, that's because there are these sensors called accelerometers and magnetometers. \"That's how we get the information about the position of the whale.\" This resulted in detailed animations of each whale's position, speed and movement. But to actually put a tag onto one of these giant mammals involved a chase. The tags are attached using suction cups, so the researchers had to use a small boat to move alongside each whale, while one member of the team used a long carbon fibre pole to \"tap\" the tag onto the animal's back. \"It's a lot easier in blue whales than some other whales, because they're so big,\" said Dr Goldbogen. \"We can programme the tag to release, so we find the tag and download the data.\" This is a far trickier exercise with beaked whales, which are smaller and dive for an hour at a time. \"If you see a beaked whale and if you don't get the tag on it, you might never see it again,\" said Dr Goldbogen. Although both studies provide clear evidence that sonar affects these rare marine mammals, the scientists say much more research is needed into the specific impacts of human activity on their environment. Dr Miller commented: \"Further research on the possible long-term impacts of these effects is needed, to evaluate whether more protection measures are required.\" Dr Goldbogen concluded: \"We didn't expect blue whales to have a strong response, so there's clearly a dearth of basic data on how animals respond to man-made sound. \"These animals have evolved in a very different environment to the one they're living in today.\"", "question": "Blue and beaked whales ' behaviour is disturbed by simulated navy sonar , according to two @placeholder studies .", "option_0": "body", "option_1": "sources", "option_2": "published", "option_3": "struggling", "option_4": "neighbours", "label": 2}
{"article": "Comic founder and writer Pat Mills and artist Kevin O'Neill have co-written Serial Killer, the first in a planned series of books. Mills started his career with Dundee-based publisher DC Thomson in the 70s. He said Scots he met during his time there and later while working in London inspired the novel's character, Joy. While at DC Thomson, Mills worked on the publisher's girls' titles Romeo and Jackie. After he left the Dundee publisher, he created the girls' mystery comic Misty and co-created the war stories comic Battle and science-fiction/fantasy comic 2000AD, which is 40 years old this year. With O'Neill, who illustrated 2000AD's Nemesis the Warlock stories and Alan Moore's famous graphic novel The Extraordinary League of Gentlemen, Mills has written Serial Killer, the first in a series of novels entitled Read Em and Weep. Mills said: \"The novels are set in the eccentric 'Life on Mars' world that was the 1970s and features classic 1970s comics, including fictional versions of Battle, Action and 2000AD. \"It's a story of revenge for a lost childhood, of flawed and eccentric characters, strange passions and arrested development.\" Joy, a journalist, is one of the book's main characters. Mills said: \"She's inspired by a number of female journalists I worked with at DC Thomson as well as Scottish women I know in London. \"One chapter in the novel comes to mind. It was inspired by a time when I worked on Romeo. \"The female journalists on Romeo and Jackie were quite outraged by the awful female hygiene products that were being aimed at teenage girls. This would have been in the early 70s. \"I'm pretty certain they won and the adverts were withdrawn which is admirable. The products quoted in the chapter of the novel, though fictional, are close to reality. \"What was difficult on teenage magazines was how to handle real teenage girl problems and I recall the editor of the Romeo problem page telling me that she wasn't allowed to deal with serious issues and she found that very frustrating. Once again, Joy mirrors this subject.\" Mills also recalls how working at DC Thomson gave him a \"love of popular culture which has stayed with me my entire life\". Describing Scotland as having a \"supportive atmosphere\" for comics, he said he found DC Thomson's comic strips \"so much funnier\" than other mainstream British comic publishers. Among those who made the comics funny was the late Manchester-born artist Ken Reid, the inspiration for another character in Serial Killer. Mills said: \"DC Thomson's fun comics were so much funnier than others and Kevin and I tackle that subject with gusto in another chapter. \"We mention Ken Reid - referred to as Ken Royce - who was a prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 of DC Thomson and was behind comic characters Jonah and Rodger the Dodger. \"Both Kevin and I are huge admirers of his wonderfully subversive material which I do think has a Scottish satirical, almost dour, element.\"", "question": "Women working in Scotland 's publishing industry @placeholder the writing of a character in a new novel by two legends of British comic books .", "option_0": "claimed", "option_1": "surrounding", "option_2": "enjoyed", "option_3": "influenced", "option_4": "owes", "label": 3}

{"article": "Unlike gangs in Europe or Canada who largely hold territory so that they can control the illegal drug markets in that area, US gangs see holding territory as an end in-and-of-itself. \"They're very territorial,\" Mr Falco said. \"It's all over claiming territory or states\". The Bandidos, one of the gangs involved in the shootout on Sunday, control Texas as part of their group's territory, he said. Members of other gangs can usually pass through or even live in Texas with little trouble, as long as they do not sport a Texas \"bottom rocker\" - a patch on the lower part of a biker's vest that shows which state the gang member is claiming. The Cossacks, who were also involved in the shooting, started as a family biker club, he said. Over time, however, their ranks grew and they began wearing the Texas bottom rocker in an act of rebellion against the Bandidos. \"It's just to say they're the biggest gang on the block,\" Mr Falco said. \"They want to keep expanding, and growing, and claiming that area as their own, and kicking out the other biker gang that might control that area.\" Mr Falco said that a lot of the violent gang members were formerly in the military, and the gangs themselves have strict military-like features. \"A biker gang is highly structured - military style structure - with a ton of rules, regulations, and built as a war machine\". The men who make up these gangs are usually older and have better training in fighting than members of other types of gangs. \"They're much more sophisticated in turning out a war,\" he said. \"A lot of these clubs started - were World War II vets or Vietnam vets - and now a lot of clubs have started based around guys returning from Afghanistan and Iraq.  So you're having an influx of new biker gangs.\" The Bandidos are no exception and formed in Texas during the Vietnam War era. Mr Falco said joining or creating a biker gang allows a small set of \"anti-social\" veterans who \"love-war\" to live out their combat fantasies. Joining is not quick or easy. The exact process of initiation varies in length and procedure from gang to gang, but they usually require inductees to go through several steps to prove their loyalty, according to Mr Falco. The current gang members often invite newcomers - called hang-arounds - to their club houses and parties. At these parties the newcomer is expected to serve drinks and carry out other menial tasks to show their loyalty. Overtime, as trust is built, the hang-around is made a prospect. \"When you prospect you get the vest, but you only get the bottom rocker,\" Mr Falco explained. \"You don't get the patch or anything that says the name of the club.\" The prospect is still required to conduct many of the humiliating tasks that newcomers are required to do, but wearing the vest allows current gang members to see how the prospect conducts himself while in uniform. \"They're going to see how you deal with the police,\" he said. \"Once you start wearing those vests... the cops are going to start messing with you.\" After further trust building, the prospect becomes a bonafide gang member. The exact procedure for this transition varies between gangs, with some requiring a consensus vote by all members and others needing only local validation. While many seek the comfort and security that gang affiliation might purport to provide, inductees often find that gang membership brings on a new set of insecurities. Vigilance is constantly required, Mr Falco said. Members keep tabs on rival gangs and on potential moles within their own ranks. Betrayal and backstabbing run rife, as members compete for power both within the gang and against other gangs. \"They're jockeying for power, one minute you have power, once you lose it everyone leaves you,\" he said. \"Some of the guys are very likable, some of them have generosity towards each other, and you think 'Oh that's really nice',\" he said. \"In reality that's all for themselves, so that they have that power, so that they have that belonging.\"", "question": "The recent gun battle in Texas has put a spotlight on violent biker gangs in the US .

{"article": "More say over energy, transport and the assembly's own elections are on offer. But a report said the draft Wales Bill was \"constricting\" the assembly, by the way it was reserving many matters as the responsibility of Westminster. Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said he was open to changes amid accusations the bill may reduce Welsh power. It proposes moving to a \"reserved powers\" model for Wales, by which all policy areas are assumed to be devolved unless specified as remaining with the UK government. Opposition parties have claimed the list of reservations is too long. Monday's report from Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre and University College London (UCL) said the UK government's latest devolution proposals were \"clunky and short-sighted\". Professor Richard Rawlings from UCL said Wales had experienced \"three deeply problematic devolution settlements\" since 1999, and there had been hopes of a process putting Welsh devolution on a \"sustainable constitutional basis\". But he warned: \"The draft Wales Bill does not do what was promised. \"All too often, the Secretary of State's fine policy objectives of a stronger, clearer, fairer and more robust devolution settlement are frustrated by provision that is constricting, clunky, inequitable and constitutionally short-sighted. Prof Rawlings said the assembly faced a \"triple squeeze\" of \"intrusive general restriction, over-occupation of legislative space, and blurry forms of executive veto\". MPs on the Welsh Affairs Committee have been carrying out their own inquiry and are expected to publish a report soon. A spokesman for the Wales Office said: \"We want the Wales Bill to create a stronger Wales within a strong United Kingdom and we published a draft bill so that we could listen to comments and make sure we get this right. \"Clearly before publishing the full bill we have to wait for the Welsh Affairs Committee to publish its report, and then give due consideration to its recommendations.\" A Welsh government spokesperson said Monday's report backed the first minister's assertion that the draft Bill was \"too important to be rushed\". \"We urge the UK government to delay introduction of the Bill and take the time needed to get this right, with proper engagement between UK and Welsh governments and other stakeholders,\" the spokesperson added. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said Monday's report echoed many of her party's concerns. \"The only way of securing a robust and sustainable devolution settlement is to give Wales parity with the other nations of the UK,\" she said. \"At present, Scotland and Northern Ireland are being handed significant tax powers while English cities will gain control over policing - all of this without a referendum. \"Time and again, Wales is forced to jump through more hoops than any other part of the UK, only to end up with less control over our own affairs.\" By the standards of the usual dry constitutional language associated with reports like this, there was some eye-catching criticism here.

{"article": "Officially the Grateful Dead had no leader. But from the band's origins in 1965 to his death 30 years later, Garcia was the best known member of a group which still evokes the excitement of American counterculture in the 1960s. As well as '60s psychedelia, the group's albums show the influence of jazz, bluegrass, mainstream pop and even their early days as a jug band.  But when they toured it was the lengthy jam sessions fans loved - and central to those was the Garcia guitar sound. Devoted Deadheads identify five classic guitars which Garcia played at different times: Alligator, Rosebud, Lightning Bolt, Tiger and Wolf. The last two were auctioned together in 2002 and made more than $1.5m (\u00a31.2m).  Now Wolf is back at the same auction house to benefit the advocacy group the Southern Poverty Law Center. Arlan Ettinger runs Guernsey's auction house in New York which is handling this month's sale. Guernsey's specialises in the unusual.  \"I've loved having a pioneering sale of John F Kennedy memorabilia or jazz artefacts,\" says Ettinger. \"But selling Tiger and Wolf the first time round was a huge thrill because real fans are amazingly passionate about the Grateful Dead. It's like they've become the ultimate rock icon of '60s America and all that excitement and the passion that went with it.\" Tiger was bought in 2002 by the hugely wealthy Jim Irsay, who owns the National Football League (NFL) team the Indianapolis Colts.  Wolf went for more than $700,000 (\u00a3543,000) to Dan Pritzker, whose family founded the Hyatt hotel chain. Ettinger remembers there had already been a lot of press interest in who owned the guitars. \"They were consigned to Guernsey's by the man who made them - the luthier [guitar maker] Doug Irwin.  In his will Jerry had bequeathed the guitars back to Doug but the band members challenged that legally. Times had been tough for Doug Irwin and he had at times been homeless. \"Everyone was saying they were worth maybe $25,000 (\u00a319,000) or $50,000 (\u00a339,000) apiece.  But we built a big auction of Grateful Dead material around them and we proved they were worth a lot more. The auction was at the ultra-hip disco Studio 54 in Manhattan which made it pretty special. \"So I was surprised and delighted when Dan Pritzker got back in contact to say all these years later he wants to auction Wolf again for charity.  Dan is intent that every dollar of the hammer price should go to the Law Center and we've agreed to that. \"Given what it sold for in 2002 and given how great a cause this is, we're hoping the Center will get more than $1.5m (\u00a31.2m) from the sale this month.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center was founded in Alabama in 1971 to focus on civil rights. Ettinger thinks Garcia would be delighted to see it benefit from the sale of Wolf. \"Southern Poverty has fought racism and hate groups and neo-Nazis through the courts. So I thought it was a noble thing for Dan Pritzker to do.  It's a pure gift with no tax write-off and there's no seller's commission for us. \"Dan told me he was deeply troubled by the direction our new government is taking.  He wanted to take some proactive steps to do something important and good with the money the auction will raise.\" The guitar's Wolf association came about almost by accident: it wasn't something Irwin included when he made the instrument. Garcia stuck a cartoon wolf on the guitar as a joke. At one point the instrument went back to Irwin for repairs and he decided to incorporate the cartoon wolf more permanently. Ettinger thinks only the most obsessive Deadheads can identify exactly which guitar Garcia played in each recording. \"But the Wolf design means you can often pick out that exact instrument at a particular concert in photographs and film footage. \"There is so much interest still in Jerry and the band. There's a new Martin Scorsese six-part TV series about them: I think that will tell us about the world they lived in, not just about their music. \"It's funny when you think of the guitar as just wood and strips of metal and wire strings.  But it takes people back to very important moments in their lives.  It's been around since 1973 so it's fantastic that all these years later it will do so much good in the world.\" The guitar will be auctioned at Guernsey's in New York on 31 May.

The move is part of a new housing project in attempts to improve conditions in the camp, which is used by about 5,000 migrants and refugees. The 125 converted containers are equipped with electricity, heating and bunk beds, and each one can accommodate 12 people. Officials had given between 1,000 and 1,500 residents until last Thursday to leave the area, but they were reportedly given a grace period until Monday. But many migrants and refugees had refused to use the new accommodation and moved their temporary homes further inside the camp, despite poor living conditions. Many reportedly feared they could be permanently trapped at the new camp, unable to continue their attempts to cross to the UK. Some also expressed their unhappiness about leaving an area where they have established a community, and are concerned about their future treatment by the authorities. \"This (the container camp) is the same as a jail. It is not good,\" one resident told the BBC. Volunteers helped residents to move their tents from the area in recent days.

{"article": "Russian MPs have backed a bill to ban \"undesirable\" foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or firms. The draft leaves the definition of \"undesirable\" open to interpretation. Under an existing 2012 law, foreign-funded Russian NGOs linked to politics must register as \"foreign agents\". The label has connotations of spying. A party loyal to President Vladimir Putin drafted the new law. His supporters dominate both houses of parliament. The text going through the Duma - Russia's lower house - says it will be up to Russian prosecutors and the foreign ministry to decide if a foreign organisation or firm is \"undesirable\". A foreigner declared \"undesirable\" could face a fine of up to 500,000 roubles (\u00c2\u00a36,343; $10,000) and up to six years in jail. The bill passed a second reading in the Duma on Friday. It still requires a third reading, then approval by the upper house (Federation Council) and President Putin to become law. In most cases that is a formality. The legislation comes amid frosty relations between Russia and the West, characterised by sanctions and counter-sanctions over Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The BBC's Yuri Vendik in Moscow says the legislation opens up foreign firms to potential prosecution, because it does not include the word \"non-commercial\" in the text. The MP who drafted it, Alexander Tarnavsky of the party A Just Russia, said he wanted foreign businesses to be covered by the law. \"Unfortunately some foreign organisations for various reasons are working against Russia. \"They may be ideological reasons, or in the interests of shareholders, or economic interests, it's normal for them to say: 'Come on, let's push Russia down, so the value of Russian shares goes down, and then we'll buy them,'\" he told the BBC. 'Pressure on foreigners' - Yuri Vendik, BBC Russian: This law is a way of strengthening pressure on foreigners - it can be seen as a political step. It doesn't give any criteria to define \"undesirable\", so it is not clear which organisations could be affected - the language is not precise. In theory they can punish whoever they like - businesses, media organisations. Or it could be an oil firm, or someone in the financial sphere. Non-governmental organisations are not clearly defined in Russian law. The text has been finished - there won't be more amendments now. But there might be a procedural delay before the Duma's third and final reading. Pavel Chikov, head of a human rights umbrella group called Agora, said: \"Simply declaring someone 'undesirable, we don't want to see him on our territory' will be a violation of international law and general legal principles, and of the civil legal code.\" He predicted \"a mass of disputes over interpretation of the law\". In a commentary on the draft law, the popular Russian daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said the \"undesirable\" label could be applied to any foreign organisation, \"commercial and non-profit alike\". It said NGOs such as Medecins Sans Frontieres, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, Reporters Without Borders and Transparency International \"are certainly under threat\". It described the new law as a \"weapon\" that could be used \"next time relations with the West escalate, or under the influence of paranoid 'anti-Maidan' nightmares\" - referring to Russian fears of a Ukraine-style popular revolt against the government.", "question": "Russia plans to introduce new @placeholder to prosecute foreigners whose activities are seen as \" undesirable \" on national security grounds .", "option_0": "laws", "option_1": "team", "option_2": "powers", "option_3": "deals", "option_4": "measures", "label": 2}

{"article": "Opposition parties and human rights groups say this would erode the independence of the judiciary. The governing Law and Justice party says the reforms are needed because the judiciary is corrupt and serves only the elite. The bill must now be signed by the president in order to become law. A demonstration against the changes is scheduled to take place in the capital Warsaw on Sunday. Since it came to power in 2015, the government of the conservative, populist Law and Justice party (PiS), has passed a series of controversial reforms, triggering mass protests. Polish senators backed the legislation in a vote in the early hours of Saturday morning. Earlier this week, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro had argued that the changes were necessary because the current system of appointing judges was undemocratic. \"We want to end corporatism and introduce the oxygen of democracy there. Because Poland is a democracy based on the rule of law. \"This is not court-ocracy,\" the minister said. But opposition parties are concerned that the law would give parliament - dominated by PiS lawmakers - a greater say  in appointing judges, violating the constitutional separation of powers. The legislation will now go to President Andrzej Duda for signing. He has given no indication he plans to veto it. A separate bill was also presented in parliament this week, which would allow the justice minister to get rid of all of Poland's Supreme Court judges and appoint new ones. This piece of legislation was not consulted beforehand and introduced to parliament in the middle of the night, reports the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw. Under the PiS government, the justice minister already wields considerable power over the prosecution service in his role as prosecutor general because he can influence prosecutors to launch investigations, our correspondent says. Grzegorz Schetyna, who leads the opposition Civic Platform party, denounced the tabling of the bill as an \"announcement of a coup\", the AFP news agency reports. Earlier this week, the Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner, Nils Muiznieks, said the reforms were \"a major setback for judicial independence\". Meanwhile, Manfred Weber, the leader of the European Parliament's largest grouping, the EPP, said \"Law and Justice is putting an end to the rule of law and leaving the European community of values\".", "question": "Poland 's parliament has approved a bill to give MPs and the justice minister the power to appoint judges without consulting judicial @placeholder .", "option_0": "activities", "option_1": "sources", "option_2": "controls", "option_3": "levels", "option_4": "circles", "label": 4}

{"article": "But a quick glimpse at any high street with its rows of closed-down signs, pound shops and charity outlets suggest that consumers don't entirely agree. Now a new phenomenon - dubbed social shopping - threatens to incorporate the missing social element in online shopping and possibly destroy even more bricks and mortar stores. Social shopping encompasses a range of ideas, from shopping within social networks, to shopping-specific search engines that use friends recommendations to group buying sites such as Groupon. Groupon harnesses the power of the crowd to bring people daily deals that they may not even have known they wanted - from manicures to mountain biking. It has a very simple business model - people sign up for offers and once the required number of people are registered, the deal is confirmed and a voucher is sent to your inbox. The firm has five million users in the UK alone, and is said to be the fastest growing company ever. It puts much of its growth down to web-based recommendations - people see a deal and spread it among their online friends but not everyone is convinced by its social credentials. \"There are a lot of myths about how social Groupon is. In the beginning many deals may have been spread via social networks but now it is primarily through a daily e-+mail,\" said Forrester analyst Sucharita Mulpuru, who has recently authored a report on social shopping. Word-of-mouth may have helped catapult Groupon into the limelight but its quarter of a billion dollar marketing spend probably played an even bigger role, thinks Ms Mulpuru. As the world's largest social network Facebook is keen that people talk to retailers as well as their friends and it is trying to figure out how to make the most out of social shopping. It boasts that half of the top 25 retailers use the site but the level of integration varies, from those who simply see it as a way to gain fans to \"like\" their brands to firms, such as clothing firm Asos, which are happy to allow users to make purchases from within the social network. Asos is one of Facebook's biggest successes. It puts its full catalogue on the site and its fan page has 800,000 members. Amazon uses the social network to offer product suggestions based on likes and favourites pulled from users' profile information. It has also introduced gift recommendations which let you know which of your friends have upcoming birthdays and suggests presents for them based on what they have shared with Amazon. Ticketing firm TicketMaster offers anyone who has bought a ticket on its site the chance to share the purchase information with their Facebook friends. It claims to have increased its revenue as a result of this feature. Meanwhile Levi's has what Facebook describes as a \"social store front\", offering users jeans that their friends may have liked and even using information to influence its supply chain. So if people in London are \"liking\" the skinny jeans most and people in Manchester are \"liking\" the bootcut style they can simply adjust their stock to match this. And herein, for Ms Mulpuru, lies the real power of social shopping - as a tool for retailers. \"There is a ton of data that people share about themselves that the retailer can use to make more relevant offers. It is far more a personalisation tactic than about getting or retaining customers,\" she said. Facebook's director of business development Christian Hernandez believes that Facebook can help users \"connect to brands that they care about\" and he reckons that among his Facebook friends there is plenty of chatter about shopping. But Ms Mulpuru is not convinced it will become a shopping hub any time soon. \"TV didn't transform retail and neither will Facebook. At the end of the day no-one buys something as the result of a link. The truth is that large brands just have not experienced any sizable gains in direct sales from Facebook,\" she said. \"In spite of hundreds of thousands of developers having been given the opportunity to create useful shopping applications or to integrate commerce into Facebook, there has yet to be a blockbuster success,\" she added. It hasn't stopped a raft of companies betting that social and shopping is a powerful combination. Three former Yahoo executives have set up a dedicated social network aimed entirely at shoppers. Dubbed ChoozOn , the start-up is built entirely around shopping and personalised deals. It allows users to manage their various deals and discount services and upcoming apps for the iPhone and Android handsets will highlight nearby deals. Users can sign up for loyalty programmes and if they share their shopping preferences and the brands and retailers they like best, the shops will fashion specific discounts for them. Meanwhile UK start-up Shopow (Shopper Power) offers a shopping search engine that aggregates thousands of retailers and products across all areas of consumer goods. Like other price comparison sites it allow users to compare goods by criteria such as price, retailer, service and delivery, but it also integrates various social functions. It will display reviews and deals that have already been collected around a product, as well as drawing in more personal views. \"Shopow is somewhere where you can interact with friends but also rate your recent purchases,\" explained co-founder Kevin Flood. He thinks people are far more likely offer to useful feedback via such a site than on Facebook. \"While some deals are appropriate to share on Facebook, you wouldn't share your experiences with a dishwasher on there,\" he said. The ability of retailers to engage directly with consumers is a very powerful one and some have taken bold steps in this direction. In February, US fashion designer Derek Lam harnessed the power of the web when he asked eBayers to vote on which of 16 dresses should form his summer collection. More than 120,000 people voted and the five winners went on sale in May. Not wanting to be left out, the high street too is embracing social media. In March, London's largest shopping centre Westfield unveiled a tweet mirror that allowed shoppers to try on an outfit and share the image in real time with friends and followers on Twitter. The mirror, brainchild of Dutch firm Nedap Retail, is already installed in dozens of shops in Belgium, France, Germany and Switzerland.

Russian forces annexed Crimea in March 2014, during Ukraine's crisis. Public transport is still running and Crimean hospitals are using generators. A state of emergency was imposed in Crimea on Sunday after two more key pylons were damaged - bringing the total to four. Monday was declared a non-working day. It is still not clear how exactly the pylons were damaged in Kherson, a Ukrainian region adjacent to Crimea. That region has been tense since Russia's annexation of Crimea - an act that was condemned internationally. Crimean Tatar activists, denying repair workers access to the damaged power lines, suggested that the weakened pylons were blown down by the wind. But Ukraine's state energy company, Ukrenergo, said the damage was caused by \"shelling or the use of explosive devices\". Russia has blamed Ukrainian nationalists from far-right party Right Sector as well as Crimean Tatar activists, calling it \"an act of terrorism\". Earlier this year those activist groups prevented food lorries crossing into Crimea. The blackout has knocked out street lighting and cut cable and mobile internet. It has also forced the closure of some 150 schools. A Crimean Tatar activist told Ukraine's TV news broadcaster 112 Ukrayina that Russia must release \"political prisoners\" and let their leader Mustafa Dzhemilev return to Crimea in exchange for repairs to the power lines. But later Mr Dzhemilev, leader of the Crimean Tatar National Movement, told BBC Ukrainian that his supporters would grant repair workers access to the power lines. \"I think that Crimea will have electricity soon\", he said. Crimean Tatar activists accuse Russia of abusing Tatar rights and denying them a voice since a pro-Moscow government was installed in Crimea. Images on social media show Ukrainian flags on some damaged pylons - and Crimean Tatar flags on others. Crimean authorities said they had managed to partially reconnect the cities of Simferopol, Yalta and Sevastopol using generators. Only 30% of Crimea's electricity is generated locally - the rest comes from Ukraine, Russia's government daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta reported. Emergency power-saving measures have been imposed: Sevastopol is getting three hours' supply, followed by a six-hour cut; in Simferopol residents have three-hour power cuts three times a day. Ukrainian authorities said they encountered activists blockading the site when they tried to repair the damaged pylons. The power cut is threatening food outlets which rely on cold storage and lack generating capacity.

But ultimately that's a hard task given that no economy of the UK's size has ever left the EU before, so there must be uncertainty about the future. Indeed, economic modelling can be a perilous business. This particular figure is underpinned by the assumption that the UK would negotiate a Canada-style trade deal in place of EU membership. The Treasury's analysis is that this would mean slower growth compared to remaining in the EU - and that would mean less tax coming into the Treasury. Brexiteers, of course, argue that the UK would secure its own unique and superior trade deal and that the analysis ignores potential trade deals that the UK outside of the EU might strike with China or India.

{"article": "\"It is just nice to feel like a mum, rather than just somebody watching,\" Anna Cox tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme, as she takes the temperature of her baby. Lola was born at just 23 weeks. She had a twin brother who sadly did not survive and she was given little hope of survival. \"During labour, one of the neo-natal consultants came to see us and painted a really bad picture that she could have all sorts of problems,\" Anna says. Lola was cared for at St James's University Hospital in Leeds -the first in the UK to implement a family integrated care system. It put parents - not nurses - in charge of everything other than the most complicated medical treatments for their premature babies while they were in hospital. \"One of the jobs we have to do is take her temperature, maybe every three or four hours,\" Anna says. \"It is a pretty simple procedure really.\" However, parents also perform more complicated tasks, including inserting a tube into their baby's nose to allow them to feed. \"There are certain things they [nurses] obviously watch over you quite a bit to begin with because it needs to be done right,\" she says. \"They do like to make sure you know what you're doing, they wouldn't just leave you to it.\" Katie Crossley's daughter, Molly, was born eight weeks early and had breathing difficulties. \"While I'm here, I pretty much do everything that a normal mum would do,\" she says. \"Everything, from feeding to medicine, cleaning, bathing.\" She has also been taught how to insert a tube up Molly's nose and into her stomach allowing her to be fed. \"Being around it and watching it has made me more confident when I've come to actually doing it,\" she says. In the past, caring for premature babies usually meant keeping parents at arm's length. As recently as 20 years ago, the closest parents of premature babies could get to their newborns was looking at them through a glass window. It meant the bond between parent and child was harder to establish and breastfeeding rates were often lower. But the idea of putting parents in charge of neonatal care is not a new one. In the 1970s in Tallinn, Estonia - then part of the Soviet Union - the head of the local hospital faced a problem. The hospital had too many premature babies to look after and not enough nurses. However, they soon noticed the system was helping babies. Under his system, mothers had more regular \"skin to skin\" contact with premature babies. It resulted in better breastfeeding rates and shorter hospital stays. It took 30 years for other hospitals to copy the system, but now the system has been introduced in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and now Leeds. Dr Liz McKechnie, consultant neonatologist at St James's, says the family integrated care scheme aims to put the parent at \"the very centre of the team caring for the baby\". \"It is not rocket science, it is such a straightforward thing to do, to allow parents to look after their babies,\" she says. She is adamant the move was not down to cost-cutting and that nursing levels on the unit have not dropped. \"In the past, care has been very much the nurse leading it, so they're saying 'right, it's feed time, it's bath time'. Whereas now, it is very much the parents who are leading that. \"They are feeding the baby when the baby needs feeding, rather than when the clock says it is feed time - and that's much better for the baby.\" She says the new system was a \"major cultural change\" and caused anxiety among nurses on the neonatal unit when it was introduced 18 months ago. Nurses on the ward say training parents to care for their babies takes as long - if not longer - than doing the procedures themselves. But they say families are getting home sooner, the long-term development of babies is improving and breastfeeding rates have increased. The system is about to be trialled in the intensive care unit in St James's sister hospital. As for Lola, she was allowed home just before she was 14 weeks old. \"Without the family integrated care we would've been in a lot longer,\" says her mother, Anna. \"Lola is still on oxygen and [otherwise] they wouldn't have allowed us to come home with that. \"I feel really confident in everything they taught us.\" Dr McKechnie adds: \"The fact is that families are going home more confident and more able to care for their babies, and that means a lot. \"Nobody wants to stop it, it is definitely here to stay, everybody can see the benefits of it.\" Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.", "question": "On a hospital ward in Leeds , parents of premature babies are @placeholder to help care for their newborns - from taking temperatures to the delicate task of inserting feeding tubes .

{"article": "I've been living in South Africa since 1997, my wife is South African and we have two children, aged 14 and 16. My wife is worried about what future our children will have if the xenophobic attacks become the norm. We don't know how to explain the hatred against Nigerians to our families, to our children. This is the third round of attacks against foreigners; one was in 2008 where people were killed, again in 2015. I now get calls from home, my family members want to know if we're safe, they see the stories in the news. I do feel safe, I feel safe because I live in the suburbs away from where the unrest and violence has been happening but I don't know if I could say that if I was living in a poorer area. There are parts of this city that are no-man's land, where the police have no control over what happens, where there are no consequences for wrong-doing, that is unfortunately where the xenophobia has thrived. There is just lawlessness from all sides, by all nationalities and that sort of environment is a ticking time-bomb. Life is different in the suburbs but I do worry about my fellow Africans who become victims in these incidents, while they have nothing to do with crime. I love this country, I consider it my home and it breaks my heart to see what is happening. The government needs to seriously address the concerns people are raising - both South Africans and foreigners. People here are saying that Nigerians are bringing drugs and prostitution but can I tell you something, while I don't condone crime, Nigerians are not the only ones involved in crime here. It's all too easy to profile one group and that is not right, it's also dangerous and puts people's lives in danger. It's important for South Africans to know that not all of us are criminals, the same way not all South Africans are engaged in crime. They need to understand that you cannot paint people with one brush. I am a hard-working man and there are many law-abiding foreigners who are helping to building the country. I own a restaurant in Randburg, we make Nigerian food and South African dishes. I also own a liquor store which has been in business since 2007. All I want to do is provide for my family and help people make a living too - some of my employees are South African. It has been a long road to get to this point. Leaving your home with nothing is not easy. There was a time when I had nothing: No money, no food, no-one. I didn't have a place to sleep and would sleep in police stations and in the streets. I moved here to study but when I came into the country, life was more difficult than I imagined it would be. It was not easy for me to register because of financial constraints but I stayed because South Africa is one of the best countries in Africa - in terms of facilities. There are better opportunities. Everyone wants a better life for themselves and their family and South Africa is seen as the best place for that but it's not easy. After years of working part-time jobs I raised enough to finally take myself to school, I completed a business management course in 2010 and that has helped me with running my businesses. South Africa is my home now, everything I own is here -  that's why I am also unhappy about the crime and the high unemployment here. These things make life difficult. I understand where the anger is coming from - obviously if you are poor and see your neighbour, who is not even from here, succeeding it will create tensions. Nigerians love being in the lime-light and have a basket-mouth [trash-talker] and are showy. When we have money, even if it's a little, we want people to know - this makes us more noticeable than other nationalities. I think the Nigerians living here need to be aware of that and be sensitive to the issues that may cause. As for the crime, I know that sometimes people do bad things to earn a living but imagine if that was your own child that was addicted to drugs or being used as a prostitute. I'm a parent and I worry about that, that's why I don't support crime at all. Other nationalities need to respect the laws of the country, we are visitors here and need to remember that. We came to South Africa for different reasons, some of us can never return to our countries, what happens then if you ruin your chances here?

{"article": "This possibility, described in a new computer modelling study, could explain why rocks from Earth and the Moon are much more alike than we would expect from this \"giant impact hypothesis\". The research forms one of three papers published in the journal Nature. Two others report subtle, previously unseen differences in lunar rocks. Scientists say the new findings paint a consistent - and much clearer - picture of our satellite's history. The modelling study, done by researchers from Israel and France, precisely simulated the turmoil of the early, inner Solar System and quantifies the variety of collisions that might have occurred. In its early stages, the proto-Earth would have been subjected to a string of brutal collisions with other wannabe planets. According to our best understanding, the last of these was a cataclysmic tangle with a planetary body just ten times lighter than Earth - and the resulting debris eventually clumped together to make the Moon. The problem is that most of what became the Moon should have come from the imposter - and based on our existing knowledge of what was flying where at that time, that imposter was thought to be a very different type of planet. \"So if the impactor had a different composition from the Earth, we should expect the Moon to have a different composition,\" Dr Hagai Perets, one of the study's authors, told the Nature podcast. But this is not the case. \"They are almost identical. This is one of the major challenges for this really beautiful giant impact hypothesis,\" said Dr Perets, from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. This is why a study made headlines in 2014 when it pinpointed some tiny differences between Earth and Moon rocks. What Dr Perets and his colleagues found in their new simulations was that the impactor planet might, in fact, have been made of surprisingly similar stuff to the Earth - leaving only the sort of subtle differences that we do see in lunar material. \"What we found is that many of these impactors on a planet have very similar composition to that of the planets they impact - as similar as what we measure between the Earth and the Moon,\" Dr Perets explained. Specifically, the models indicated a 20% chance that the impact could have been between such similar proto-planets. These odds give our prevailing \"origins story\" for the Moon a fighting chance, Dr Perets said. \"[Now] I am even more confident about the giant impact hypothesis.\" A different challenge to our current ideas about the Moon relates to what happened subsequently. To explain certain details in the Earth's make-up, scientists have proposed that both the Earth and Moon amassed a large amount of extra matter - a so-called \"late veneer\" - during a subsequent period when they were bombarded by huge numbers of meteorites. And just like the original giant impact, this process should also have left a trail of evidence that had not been detected until now. Even if, as the French-Israeli study now suggests, the Earth and Moon got started from very similar building blocks, this bombardment should have had a much bigger effect on the bulkier, heavier Earth with its much stronger gravity, shifting the balance of its ingredients away from that of the Moon. The two new investigations of lunar rocks, one from the US and one from Germany, find support for that shift for the first time, by analysing samples from the Apollo missions with new levels of precision. Both teams looked specifically at traces of tungsten within small chunks of the Moon that they borrowed from Nasa, and found a small but tell-tale difference compared to Earth rock. The ratio of the metal's different isotopes was altered. Importantly, the ratios measured by the two teams match - and the difference fits what might be expected if the Earth collected a bigger \"veneer\" from the bombardment. \"The small, but significant, difference in the tungsten isotopic composition between Earth and the Moon perfectly corresponds to the different amounts of material gathered by Earth and the moon post-impact,\" said Prof Richard Walker from the University of Maryland, one of the authors on the US study. Considering the three studies in total, Dr Matthias Willbold from the University of Manchester told the BBC he was impressed and excited. \"They all tell the same story - it all falls into place,\" said Dr Willbold, a planetary scientist who has also investigated the late veneer idea using tungsten ratios. \"It's quite striking. [The lunar rock studies] mention that it is quite baffling that the Earth and Moon have the same starting composition, before the bombardment. \"And that links perfectly into the modelling paper, where they say look - we can resolve that.

{"article": "Now imagine the same landlord throws in a bowl of chips for free - because you are a regular at the pub three nights a week. Then the pub closes for a couple of weeks for refurbishment. So, you go to another pub - The Red Lion - a few hundred yards further down the road. A little surprisingly, the landlord at that pub knows your favourite pint too, even though you have never been in before. You find out that the Dog and Duck landlord has sold on information about your tastes to the landlord at The Red Lion. How do you feel? A bit concerned, perhaps. But worse is to come. You subsequently find out that - knowing what you are going to order - the landlord at The Red Lion has charged you 10p more than he has charged another customer. You don't even get a free bowl of chips! This might seem like a very far-fetched example. However, shift this whole buying process online - and it sums up a big issue for internet shoppers. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) wants to know more about personalised pricing. This occurs if a retailer offers different prices depending on information they have collected about that customer. This is done primarily in two ways. Firstly, retailers can collect details of a customer's previous purchases made on the website. Secondly, they can buy information about the customer's purchases or internet searches from a third party. The OFT wants to know if consumers are aware that all this data is being collected about their shopping and searching preferences, as well as if this puts consumers off buying on the internet. The regulator says that there is no evidence, but a lot of concern, that this information allows retailers to charge a higher price to certain customers - just like the hypothetical landlord at The Red Lion. \"It is important we understand what control shoppers have over their profile and whether firms are using shoppers' profiles to charge different prices for goods or services,\" says Clive Maxwell, chief executive of the OFT. Concerns have been raised about flights or hotel rates. It is alleged that in some cases, when a potential customer has looked once, then taken a few minutes to compare the cost elsewhere, they return to find the price may have risen. However, there has been no firm proof of this. Other suggestions have included different prices for people using different brands of computers, or living in different areas, as they give an indication of their wealth. Of course, such a scenario could work in a consumer's favour. A regular customer, or one the retailer would like to keep, may be offered a discount, just like the free bowl of chips in our earlier example. \"This is the transfer online of something that has been happening offline for a very long time,\" says Vanessa Barnett, partner and online marketing expert at law firm Charles Russell. The essential difference, she says, is that receiving a discount in person is much more obvious than when it is done online. She adds that consumers always have the power to withdraw their custom from the scurrilous retailer, online or offline. Technology commentator Tom Cheesewright agrees. Consumers do not like being unfairly treated because of what online retailers know about them, but they do like the discounts and better treatment that might come from the same information. So, where does this information come from anyway? Clearly, retailers can track the purchases a customer makes at their online store. In addition, websites can record information in text files called cookies. Cookies are widely used to record what repeat visitors view on a site and by advertisers to track users online. They are also used to recognise customers, make suggestions, or store their details to make the process quicker. There has been particular concern about tracking cookies, used by advertisers, which keep tabs on the various websites that you browse, so they can target you with \"relevant\" advertisements. Official statistics show that online sales were 11% higher in October than the same month a year earlier. So, this information can be very valuable indeed. Concerns about cookies have already prompted action under European law which came into force on 26 May. It requires websites to explain what cookies are and to get users' permission before using them. So, a permission request will be popping up relatively regularly at the moment for internet users. In the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) recently said that it would launch a crackdown on those not complying, although there are suggestions that many websites are failing to do so. They could face fines of up to \u00c2\u00a3500,000 each. In the US, regulators are urging internet companies to have a \"do not track\" system in place that gives consumers more control over their personal data online. In a separate development in the UK, the Department for Business has a \"midata\" programme, which encourages various banks and energy companies to release data about a customer's consumption if it is requested. Unlike online tracking, this simply keeps a note of their consumption habits of, for example, their gas and electricity. In these fields, it may allow people access to details that would help them get the most appropriate tariff. It remains to be seen whether the government will eventually legislate to encourage supermarkets to release similar data. This data is gathered on loyalty cards, which hold information about families' eating habits, when they shop, and how much they spend. At this point, the gap between data gathered by an online shopper and somebody who visits a store narrows significantly. As a result, such trends have attracted the attention of the government and the regulator.

He said his main concern was people's \"rationale\" for going to IS-controlled areas. \"The real concern is that they will be radicalised, desensitised, exposed to real atrocities that will change their outlook on life and may affect their behaviour back here in the UK,\" he said. \"It absolutely keeps me awake at night; we're talking about predominantly young people with not a great deal of life experience who are receiving a very corrupt narrative.\" Prevent, a government counter-terrorism strategy, is one method employed by East Midlands officers to engage with young people. The scheme has been controversial and has been criticised for possibly stigmatising Muslims. However, PC Rizwaan Chothia, who runs Prevent courses in the region, said it was about trying to intervene at an early stage. He said: \"There is a misconception that exists out there that the Prevent agenda is about spying on the Muslim community. \"As a Muslim police officer, a practising Muslim, I would be mortified if that was the case...

{"article": "US researchers say the slow-is-more-accurate rule generally applies. In a series of calculations, they looked at the physics behind releasing a projectile with the human arm. Their equations suggest a slow underarm throw is the best strategy for getting a piece of paper into a nearby bin. Lead researcher Madhusudhan Venkadesan, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Yale University, said faster throws tend to be less accurate. This is because the ball travels in a nearly straight line, so any errors in the angle at which the object is released tend to be amplified. In slow and curved flight paths, small errors in the angle of release have little effect, he said. \"What we find is that almost the slowest arc is often the most accurate,\" said Dr Venkadesan. \"We've compared these calculations to published data of people throwing into wastebaskets; we've compared it to a study in dart throwing.\" In sports such as basketball or darts, the strategy depends on conditions and the trade-off needed between speed and accuracy. For example, experienced darts players throw overarm at about 5.5 metres per second, optimally releasing the dart 17 to 37 degrees before the arm becomes vertical. On the cricket pitch, fielders are more likely to strike the wicket with a fast underarm throw. And in basketball, the underhand free throw, nicknamed \"the granny throw\", has a marginal advantage over overhand, despite almost disappearing from the game.

She says they tried to move on. 05:52 - The Lib Dem peer Jeremy Purvis says Labour may now be in terminal decline in Scotland. Catherine Stihler, Labour MEP, says she completely and utterly disagrees. She says Labour will hold SNP to account over public services. 04:59 - Nicola Sturgeon, returned as MSP for Glasgow Southside, says she will govern in the interests of all in Scotland. Offers to govern with courage, confidence and imagination. In keeping with her approach during the campaign, no overt mention of independence. 04:48 - Very good result for Labour in Edinburgh Southern. Bucks the trend - as Edinburgh South did last year in the UK General Election. Early indications of list voting suggest strong showing by the Greens. Could that overhaul the Lib Dem performance? We shall see. 04:29 - Another Conservative victory in Aberdeenshire West. Very good night for them. Perhaps this justifies Ruth Davidson's decision to major on defence of the Union. Perhaps adds to questions for Labour - who mostly avoided the constitution. 04:24 - Smile until your jaws ache, Ruth Davidson advised her candidates at the manifesto launch. She has just followed that advice in winning her Edinburgh seat. Adds to a very good night thus far for the Tories. She said it was sending a message to the SNP 03:49 - Congratulations to Iain Gray on winning East Lothian. You will recall that he stepped down as Labour leader after a poor performance by his party at Holyrood elections in 2011. Asked whether Kezia Dugdale should do the same, he replied: \"Absolutely not.\" That appears to be a common - although not universal - view in the Labour Party. Rather they want to think, hard, about their strategy.  If they fall behind the Conservatives into second place, that rethink might gain a certain edge. 02:42 - Tavish Scott, returned as Lib Dem MSP for Shetland, says there is a need to rethink how an alternative government can be offered to challenge the SNP. Hints of realignment? Perhaps, although Mr Scott declined to be drawn. Story of the night so far? SNP victories, Labour defeats, Tory advance. Plus those LibDems victories in the isles. More to come. 02:32 - Very good result for Tories in Eastwood - their victory driven by the emerging pattern of Labour decline. Warmly welcomed by David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, who said it confirmed that his party was en route for second place and an opportunity, as he put it, to close the sore of independence. 02:30 - Another result. Another very poor result for Labour. For the Tories, this could be insubstantial in wider terms but that is a decent increase in the vote in Hamilton. More to come, much more, but it seems that the rethink in Labour ranks will have to be deep and searching. No political party has a right to exist, let alone to command support. Labour - again, to stress, on results so far - may be facing a fundamental reappraisal. 01:04 - Congratulations to the first MSPs in Orkney and Rutherglen. That Orkney result is a good victory for Liam McArthur. Does it signal more than Orcadian effort or can it extrapolate to a limited degree? The Rutherglen result is very poor for Labour. They focused on this seat, Kezia Dugdale visited it early, James Kelly is a doughty fighter. And still the SNP swept it all away. Rutherglen in 2011 signalled an SNP majority. Tonight it signals, perhaps, a further Labour calamity. 00:40 - Without a result being declared, the early editions of the newspapers have had to call the outcome -and they have opted for suggesting that the SNP will win. I expect they may be right.  Interesting that sundry SNP voices, including the former leader Alex Salmond, are stressing how big a deal it would be for them to retain an overall majority, given the voting system for Holyrood. They are, of course, right in that regard. When the voting system was devised, by Labour, it was intended to prevent a party (they meant the SNP) from winning a majority with a minority of the vote. Nobody envisaged the current degree of support for the SNP. 00:31 - Andrew Dunlop, a Conservative Minister at the Scotland Office, says people do not know what Labour stands for. That is a sentiment I have heard expressed - but by key Labour figures. They believed the programme they set out at this election - increased tax and public spending - might begin to address that dilemma. Thomas Docherty is now overtly challenging that programme - before a result has been declared. 00:17 - Thomas Docherty, the former Labour MP, has said that his party is now fighting with the Conservatives for second place. He says that they stood on an \"unambiguously Socialist programme\" - and must draw lessons from the apparent slide in support. The manifesto they stood on, he says, is \"self-immolation for dummies\". Mr Docherty who has been standing for a Holyrood seat also criticises the decision to increase tax for all. An early indication, if one were needed, that a period of introspection may follow for Labour. Yes, another one. 23:36 - Labour appears torn tonight between preliminary optimism and pre-emptive pessimism.  Speakers for the party are talking up the worth of their campaign.

{"article": "Conversations with Arab and Western sources make it clear there is a major unifying goal in these new discussions: to avoid the collapse of Syria's security forces and its civilian institutions. That means all sides are now moving away from rigid positions taken when Syria's uprising erupted more than four years ago. \"[President Bashar al-] Assad leaving before the process starts doesn't make sense any more,\" a senior Arab diplomat in the region told me. \"If he leaves suddenly, two-thirds of his commanders would go with him and Syria would collapse.\" The steady rise of the so-called Islamic State, and mounting pressures on a stretched Syrian army has rung alarm bells over the threat of an ungoverned Syria falling into the hands of extremists. The risk posed by another fractured Middle East country is now too big to ignore. So is this summer's tragic exodus of hundreds of thousands of Syrians desperate to reach Europe. Then, the startling September surprise of Russia's air sorties into Syria set the stage for the most determined diplomacy of Syria's crisis. Ideas emerging from Arab and Western capitals include a ceasefire, an amnesty for forces on both sides, and a transitional government intended to ensure an orderly process that would lead to the drafting of a new constitution and elections. There's talk of a transition that could last up to two years. Some of these ideas are also appearing in reports about proposals coming from Russia and Iran.  Iran has had its own \"four-point plan\" for a few years, which was studied with interest by the UN. But it stayed on the shelf while Iran was kept out of talks. Integrating an array of armed forces will be fraught with difficulties, if not dangers, but there is a hope that the reform of civilian structures is within easier reach. Sources speak of discussions concerning which senior members of President Assad's team would be asked to leave - a figure of 10 -15 people was cited. There's also a hope that new, more credible, leaders will emerge from the opposition during this period to replace figures seen as lacking support inside Syria. \"They're nice people but they have no base,\" is how one source backing the opposition put it. Having convincing alternatives to take charge is seen as crucial to reassure Russia and Iran, who back President Assad. I'm told that names of possible candidates are already being drawn up and shared. An official involved in recent talks with Russia quoted the Russians in this way: \"Where is the opposition? If you can assure us it will work we are not wedded to Assad.\" Iran and Russia recently stepped up their military support to bolster President Assad's embattled position on many key fronts. But in private, officials have said for some time that their objective is to \"save Syria, not Assad.\" The biggest gap, however, is still over how long President Assad can remain part of the process. His opponents insist this process cannot start with him unless it is absolutely clear it will end without him. This week's press conference in Riyadh, which saw Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir and the visiting British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond calling for a fixed departure provoked a sharp rebuke from Damascus. Syrian Information Minister Umran al-Zu'bi condemned those with \"blood on their hands\" who were \"speaking about the internal affairs of a country that has always been and will remain free and owns its decisions.\" In the end, it is Syrians themselves who will have to make the tough choices.  Members of the Free Syrian Army, seen as moderate forces, have been visiting Moscow in a sign that there may be room for discussion. But powerful groups linked to al-Qaeda, as well as Islamic State fighters, want nothing to do with this negotiated process. They're on terrorist black lists so they aren't invited anyway, but there is still a long hard campaign ahead to try to dislodge them. And there is still deep scepticism that gaps in the negotiating process can be closed, and still deep-seated suspicion and animosity between arch rivals Iran and Saud Arabia, along with some other Gulf states. Saudi King Salman received telephone calls from President Vladimir Putin and President Barack Obama in the past week, and visits from US Secretary of State John Kerry and Philip Hammond. The Saudi monarch is understood to have given his blessing to Iran's inclusion in the process. Foreign Minister Al-Jubeir told me: \"I wouldn't call it a place at the negotiating table, it's about being part of the conversation.\" And if this fails, there is clearly a Plan B on all sides, for an accelerated military option. Military supplies are already being stepped up even as talks proceed. \"It's not going to be easy and the longer it takes, the more complicated it gets,\" is how a senior Arab diplomat in the region put it. \"That's why an orderly process is better than a military one where institutions collapse.\"", "question": "The most concerted diplomatic push so far to end Syria 's punishing war has concentrated @placeholder on all sides of a bitter divide .", "option_0": "it", "option_1": "minds", "option_2": "syria", "option_3": "impact", "option_4": "forces", "label": 1}
{"article": "English Heritage (EH) is calling on members of the public to assess Grade II listed buildings in their area and flag up if they think they are falling into disrepair. There are 345,000 Grade II listed buildings in England and the body has extended its Heritage at Risk Register to include these types of sites for the first time. The list already covers Grade II buildings in London and Grade I and Grade II* buildings in the rest of England but the list is expected to increase as Grade II buildings account for 92% of all those listed. Buildings already identified as \"at risk\" include the oldest house in Nottingham, a women only lido in Reading and a bomb store in Suffolk. EH was at the nuclear bomb facility at Barnham to launch the scheme. John Ette, inspector of monuments for English Heritage, said: \"We've always targeted Grade I, Grade II* and scheduled monuments, but this year we're targeting Grade II listed buildings via a series of pilot studies to extend what we're learnt. \"We're working with local authorities, building preservation trusts or owners to look at what we can do with the Grade II ones, so we'll try to do up to 15 pilot studies to see what we can learn.\" Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, said: \"Grade II buildings are the bulk of the nation's heritage treasury. \"When one of them is lost, it's as though someone has rubbed out a bit of the past - something that made your street or your village special will have gone.\" To begin the project, EH has earmarked \u00a3250,000 to run the pilot surveys. Edward Impey, director of heritage protection for English Heritage, said they would choose a diverse range of areas including urban, rural and those with higher economic challenges for the scheme which will run for a year. EH staff have been redeployed in new Heritage at Risk teams in each of EH's nine local offices to work exclusively on supporting owners, developers, local authorities and volunteers in rescuing buildings so they can be removed from the list. Mr Impey said: \"The point of the list is to catch things early - some Grade II buildings don't exist any more. \"We don't know how many buildings are at risk but our ambition is to assess them all and look at how many are deemed to be at risk. \"The first thing we need to know is their condition on a case-by-case basis.\" EH will publish an assessment guide online so people can review a building from the outside and gauge if it is at risk. He said: \"We'll ask them things like: 'Is it occupied, has it got broken windows and plants growing out of the gutters?'.\" Once a building is submitted it will be assessed by English Heritage who will work with funding bodies and local authorities and groups to try to put together a restoration programme. But EH will not be able to fund all of the work - the body has seen its own budget cuts from \u00a330m in 1999 to \u00a312.5m. And while in the past developers might repair a building knowing they could sell it and recoup their costs, the \"conservation deficit\" has  rocketed during the recession. From 2007 to 2012 the deficit - which is the shortfall between the cost of repairs and the money an owner could expect to recoup from the market value of a repaired property - increased from \u00a3330m to \u00a3423m. The average deficit per site rose from \u00a3267,000 to \u00a3366,000. But Mr Impey said despite budgets being squeezed he still believed people were interested in saving buildings. \"Its difficult for local authorities because they are very hard pressed and there are fewer conservation staff but that doesn't mean the will isn't there,\" he said. \"English Heritage funds have diminished too but there are other sources of money and people are very good at raising money. \"The whole thing depends on people's enthusiasm but people in England are very passionate about our historic buildings.\"", "question": "A national public body has announced plans to attempt to save England 's Grade II listed buildings from the @placeholder of neglect .", "option_0": "consequences", "option_1": "threat", "option_2": "side", "option_3": "amount", "option_4": "end", "label": 1}
{"article": "The findings, presented at the Neuroscience 2016 conference, harnessed data from 2.4 million people who downloaded the game. Getting lost is one of the first symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. And the researchers at University College London believe the results could help make a dementia test. Sea Hero Quest is a nautical adventure to save an old sailor's lost memories. With the touch of a smartphone screen, players sail a boat round desert islands and icy oceans. The game anonymously records the player's sense of direction and navigational ability as they work their way through the levels. Some require them to weave through waterways and fire a flare back home, while others challenge them to memorise a sequence of buoys and then sail round them. Data harnessed from the flare levels is the first to have been analysed, by scientists at University College London. And it suggests the sense of direction declines consistently after the teenage years. Players aged 19 were 74% accurate at firing the flare back home, but accuracy fell year by year until it reached 46% at age 75. Dr Hugo Spiers told the BBC: \"What we're able to announce to the world is it does decline across the lifespan, the ability to shoot the flare back to the target - that sense of direction.\" The data also suggests men have a slight better sense of direction than women and that the Nordic nations outperform the rest in the world, although it is not yet clear why. Ideas include: The point of the research is to develop a way of diagnosing dementia in its earliest stages - something not yet possible. Becoming completely disorientated is normally rare, but is more common in people with Alzheimer's disease. Having a record of the normal decline in the internal compass could help doctors spot patients developing Alzheimer's. Dr Spiers added: \"The value of a future test built from Sea Hero Quest is that we will be able to provide a diagnostic for Alzheimer's dementia and a tool that allows us to monitor performance in drug trials.\" Hilary Evans, the chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Sadly, we hear all too frequently of people getting lost and being found miles away from home. \"Researchers believe that these problems with spatial navigation could form the basis of a diagnostic test for the early stages of diseases like Alzheimer's, which could add a valuable tool to a clinician's diagnostic armoury. \"For any new diagnostic tool to be effective, it must take into account natural variation in a particular skill or ability across the population.\" Using the game has provided scientists with unprecedented amounts of data from across the globe.

{"article": "Tour operators are bringing home UK tourists in Tunisia following a Foreign Office warning that another terror attack is \"highly likely\". Thousands of UK tourists booked to travel on summer package deals are being given an alternative or a refund. The financial impact for independent travellers could be more complex. So what does the change in Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice mean for your summer getaway? The FCO now advises against all but essential travel to Tunisia owing to the risk of a further terrorist attack after a gunman killed 38 holidaymakers, including 30 Britons, in the 26 June beach attack near Sousse. This has prompted tour operators to start bringing more than 3,000 holidaymakers back to the UK, and about 500 independent travellers have also been advised to return. Although this travel advice could be changed at any time, many tour operators have cancelled flights and holidays to Tunisia for the summer season. For the most part, those with package deals can go to another destination, or get their money back. Most of those who are travelling back early will get a refund for the holiday days lost. Customers should get in touch with their tour operator, travel agent or possibly their airline. Those travelling in the next 48 hours are being given priority. Travel association Abta suggests that anyone with bookings beyond the summer should wait until closer to their departure date before getting in touch. The biggest operators - such as Thomson - are allowing people to choose from any destinations \"currently on sale\". Clearly, the biggest operators will have more choice of destination. Holidaymakers should be given a decent choice, rather than a \"take it or leave it option\". In the rules of Abta-registered package deals is a right to an alternative holiday or a full refund - the customer can choose between the two. This is where things get a little more complicated. Airlines will generally reschedule flights, allowing people to travel at a different time or to a different destination. Cancellation fees may apply for accommodation or car hire. To get that money back, a claim on travel insurance may be needed. Some travel insurance policies, but not all, will cover the cost of cancellation. Many of those who only bought flights and are in Tunisia now are being helped by tour operators, but others should contact their airline. It is in the small print, but the insurer will be able to tell you. First of all, you would need to have bought the travel insurance before the advice from the FCO changed to advise against all but essential travel. Some insurers would have required policyholders to pay a bit more for travel disruption cover. Q&A for holidaymakers from Abta Foreign Office advice for travel to Tunisia No, no additional compensation is paid to package holiday customers. Thomson and First Choice are giving a \u00c2\u00a350 discount to some customers who take new flights to some alternative destinations. Those who are there are being strongly advised to return. Those who want to go should be looking at the FCO advice to find out when it might be safe again to travel.

The admission is part of deal with prosecutors that could see Mr Hastert serve up to six months in prison. The plea represents a dramatic fall for the former senior US politician. The plea agreement, seen by the BBC, says that Mr Hastert \"agrees to enter a voluntary plea of guilty to Count 2\", which charged him with \"structuring and assisting in structuring currency transactions\". \"Structuring\" is a term used to describe the act of removing several small sums of money (in this case less than $10,000) in order to avoid rules that require banks to report large transactions. Count 1 alleged that Mr Hastert had lied to the FBI during the investigation.

Jolene Burdge told ABC News in June that her late brother Steve Reinboldt never came forward about the alleged abuse because he feared \"no-one would believe him\". She said he told her about the abuse in 1979, when he revealed he was gay. The FBI interviewed Ms Burdge, who has considered coming forward with her brother's story in the past, in May. Ms Burdge never asked Mr Hastert for money, but she thinks the unnamed person cited in the case as being paid off knows what happened to her brother. Mr Hastert served as speaker of the House of Representatives from 1999 to 2007, when he resigned from the chamber after the Republicans lost control.

{"article": "The topic? Federalism, of course. It has been on Liberal (and now Lib Dem) stocks for so long, it has tended to suffer a little from benign neglect. Like much-loved socks stuffed at the back of a drawer. Liberals were sincere, of course. They meant it. They advocated federalism. But, occasionally, one was left with the impression they had not fully thought through the consequences for disparate governance in these islands. They believed in federalism. They had always believed in federalism. QED. But now? Why, federalism is the topic du jour or, more precisely, de la semaine. Only this week, not one but two senior politicians from Scotland have advanced its merits. Today we heard from Murdo Fraser, in a published paper. Mr Fraser is a thinking Conservative who blends serious contemplation with a charming capacity for ironic self-deprecation. In a report for Reform Scotland, he says federalism is an idea whose time has come. Mr Fraser says that the disparate nature of the vote in the EU referendum - Scotland and Northern Ireland Remain, England and Wales Leave - reinforces the case for further decentralisation in the UK. According to Mr Fraser, the answer is federalism. An entrenched Scottish Parliament, an English Parliament sharing time at Westminster, English city regions with administrative but not legislative power, the replacement of the House of Lords with a senate representing \"each federated part of the UK.\" I do not intend in these musings to examine this particular set of ideas too closely. My attention is more aimed at the other advocate of federalism this week, Labour's Kezia Dugdale. But perhaps I might note that there would remain practical difficulties, largely caused by the mismatch in size between Scotland and England. Federalism between those two territories would be like federating California and Connecticut. Without the other 48 US states for counter-weight. Say there is a Tory majority in England and a Labour majority in the UK. Would the Tory first minister in England, representing the vast majority of the UK population, be content to have, say, defence and foreign policy decisions taken by the Labour UK leader? Well, perhaps, that is a consequence of federating. And perhaps Murdo Fraser is right to say that his plan answers both West Lothian and the issue of the Upper House in a single bound. Let us leave that to one side for a moment, aware that it is a topic which we shall address again.  Let us instead consider the contribution advanced by Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader. She not only advocated federalism in a speech this week. She went further and suggested it might offer a solution to the Brexit dilemma for Scotland. To be fair, Ms Dugdale does not advance that case with any obvious vigour. Indeed, she notes that her proposal is set forward \"tentatively\". But she does say \"there might be a possibility that Scotland could retain its place both in the UK and in the EU\" through such a solution. That dual approach, says Ms Dugdale, was endorsed by the people of Scotland in two referendums, 2014 and this year. I have to say it is not immediately apparent to me how EU membership would be achieved via federalism. For one thing, the EU is a creature of treaty. Between member states, not their constituent parts. Germany is already a federal state. The L\u00c3\u00a4nder take part in consideration of EU proposals when the topic in question forms part of their competence. But it is still Germany as a whole which is the member, bound by treaty. I cannot instantly see how, for example, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg could retain links with Brussels if Berlin had declared that Germany was leaving the EU. Further, how would federal Scottish membership of the EU operate? We are presuming that England and Wales have left the EU - and its treaty obligations - on the basis of the referendum outcome in those territories. Could Scotland alone be a federal part of the single market? How would that operate when Scotland would remain part of the UK, part of its tax system, part of its banking system, part of its monetary system? If Scotland, alone, were in the single market, would there continue to be freedom of movement of labour between Scotland and the EU? That might be thought to be a contingent element of retaining the single market. But if EU workers remained free to travel to Scotland in search of employment, how could they be prevented from popping down the M74 to England, to Manchester, to Liverpool, to London? To areas, in short, which would be by then outside the EU. Remember it is not proposed that Scotland leaves the UK, under this scenario. It is federalism, not independence. There would not be a formal border at Carlisle or Berwick. How, then, could freedom of movement operate? Ms Dugdale says there is a duty placed upon her and all of us to pay heed to the democratic mandate delivered by the people of Scotland. Which is intriguing given that an unalloyed supporter of the Union - like Ruth Davidson, for example - would say that Scotland's votes contributed to a UK mandate, rather than comprising one in their own right. Nevertheless, the Labour leader is undoubtedly right to argue that all avenues should be explored in response to the Brexit vote. Some, I would tentatively suggest, are likely to prove more productive than others.", "question": "For years , nay decades , it was a topic only touched , if at all , by eager Liberals at party conferences .

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device The new Premier League season starts this weekend and former England captain Lineker is rueing a rash tweet from back in December. He had so little faith in Leicester - his former team, who he scored 95 goals for in 194 appearances - holding on to their lead in the Premier League that he pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if they won the championship. The Foxes went on to win their first top-flight title by 10 points. So, will he go ahead with it live on BBC One at 22:30 BST? \"I am doing my best to pluck up the courage to go there with just my undies on, as I said I would,\" Lineker told BBC Sport. \"When I tweeted that silly bet back in December, I categorically knew there was zero chance of Leicester winning the league. Zero chance. It happened but it was magical, it was great. \"It is a one off and a sporting miracle that has landed me in my underwear.\" Judging by this Instagram post, it hasn't escaped Lineker's mind... Even Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri is keen to see what happens. There have been messages of support - or concern - from fellow ex-professionals.

{"article": "Labour MP, John McDonnell wants the law changed to allow MPs to job-share, a move which he says would help make Parliament more diverse. This \"minor, modernising reform\" would, he claims, help women, disabled people and carers to stand as candidates and make the House of Commons more reflective of the people it serves. But the move has been described as \"bonkers\", \"outrageous\", a \"dangerous attempt at constitutional meddling\" and a \"crackpot idea\" that would make Parliament \"like a reality TV show\". In 2010 a committee, set up by the Speaker, looked into representation in Parliament and said it was a matter of justice \"that there should be a place within the House of Commons for individuals from all sections of society\". Mr McDonnell, who has cross-party support for his bill, argues that Parliament is far from representative at the moment - more than 75% of MPs are male and only a small number of MPs are disabled. He says other public services and businesses are embracing the idea of job-sharing and it is time politics followed suit. Under the plans, two people who want to stand for the same party would enter into a job-sharing agreement before an election and both their names would then appear on the ballot paper. Once in the Commons, each job-sharing MP would be entitled to a half-vote on legislation and Commons motions, with one able to cast a full vote if both MPs were in agreement. The plans would not cost the taxpayer any more as both job-sharers would share one MP's allowances between them. Although the exact way in which MPs might share their workload once elected has yet to be worked out, the Labour MP wants to get the principle of job-sharing into law - which currently lets only a \"single member\" be elected per constituency. The plan has been backed by a number of politicians, barristers, journalists, academics and comedian Jo Brand. Deborah King, who has been campaigning for the change and set up an e-petition to try and get it debated in the Commons, says it's a matter of disability rights. \"Disabled people haven't got effective representation in the United Kingdom,\" she says. \"We need 65 disabled MPs if we are to reflect the population of the UK.\" \"There are plenty of disabilities that prevent people from working full-time, but that shouldn't be a barrier.\" Robert Halfon, Conservative MP for Harlow, who has a walking disability, has chosen not to talk about his disability, choosing instead to campaign in other areas. But he has decided to back Mr McDonnell's bill, across the party divide, because he thinks Parliament needs a \"radical shake-up\". \"To be a full-time MP with a significant disability is incredibly difficult,\" he says. \"Parliament is a gruelling place. Contrary to what the media reports, the hours are long. We are often here late at night voting. \"The amount of walking you do from building to building and meeting to meeting is quite extraordinary. \"And you've got a lot activities on Friday, Saturday and Sunday in the constituency which involve additional walking around.\" Allowing job-share MPs would, Mr Halfon says, bring Parliament into line with other workplaces and widen the number of people who would think about becoming an MP. Others have raised the issue of gender equality and boosting the number of female MPs - who are seen as more likely to have caring and family responsibilities that are seen as a barrier to women standing for Parliament. Conservative MP Claire Perry has backed the notion of job-sharing cabinet posts as a \"powerful signal\" that would \"allow women to achieve their best and also recognise the complexity of many of our lives\". One disabled MP, Dame Anne Begg, who was vice chair of the Speaker's conference and has added her name to the bill, wants to see the idea \"get an airing\" but is all too aware of some of the practical problems. \"If someone's constituency is far away a job share that splits the week is not necessarily going to be possible. \"And because we often don't know what the business in the House will be until a week before, both MPs may want to be in Parliament at the same time if things they are interested in are being debated. \"Constituents may also end of going to both MPs. This happens now in the Scottish Parliament, where we have constituency members and regional members.\" Concerns have also been raised about how membership of select committees would work for job-sharers, how much time each MP would get to speak in the House and whether constituencies with two MPs would get an advantage by having more representation than those with only a single MP. Deborah King insists these kinds of difficulties can be overcome: \"These are reasonable adjustments that disabled people need made for them in the workplace. \"Workplaces up and down the country make reasonable adjustments for disabled people and the House of Commons needs to get into the 21st century.\" However, Tory MP Sir Roger Gale says the idea is simply incompatible with the role of an MP and is \"parliamentary populism and opportunism at its absolute worst\". \"Members of the public elect members of parliament. They don't elect time-sharers and it's not a job that you can do time-sharing. \"A member of parliament has to be on top of absolutely everything effecting his constituents, his postbag and his parliamentary work himself. \"It's simply not possible to simply just hand everything over to somebody else half way through the day. \"I think this is sheer lunacy and completely impractical and I cannot see it going anywhere at all. \"You become a member of parliament as a vocation and it involves very many hours of work, a huge amount of commitment and a huge amount of sacrifice on the part of people's families. \"If people aren't prepared to do that they shouldn't stand for parliament. There are many other ways in which they can serve society.\" Mr McDonnell's bill is what is known as a 10 minute rule bill, which means there is very little chance the change will become law - something which supporters like Mr Halfon accept. But the \"nettle has been grasped\" he says. \"It's important not just to knock this idea down but actually look at ways we could take this forward.\"", "question": "How would you feel if you had not one MP , but two ?

{"article": "The vehicle, with Bertrand Piccard at the controls, left Mandalay in Myanmar (Burma) just after 21:00 GMT on Sunday, and is heading for Chongqing in China. The intention is to make a brief stop there, and then try to reach Nanjing on the east coast of the country. This would set up Solar Impulse for the first of its big ocean crossings - a five-day, five-night flight to Hawaii. Mission control will not make a decision on the Nanjing leg until late on Monday. The decision may rest on the state of the energy reserves held in the plane's batteries. China's air traffic authorities would like the team to start the sixth leg before dawn. But if the reserves are marginal then Solar Impulse will be held in Chongqing until the batteries can be charged. The problem with this scenario is that poor weather is forecast in the Chongqing region in the coming days, and if Solar Impulse does not leave straightaway, it could be delayed for perhaps a week. Solar Impulse took off from Mandalay International Airport in darkness at 03:36 local time, Monday (21:06 GMT Sunday). Leg five is long one - about 1,375km - and is expected to take roughly 19 hours. It would see Solar Impulse landing around midnight local time at Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport. It is 20 days since the venture got under way from Abu Dhabi. The Swiss-based project expects the circumnavigation of the globe to be completed in a total of 12 legs, with a return to the Emirate in a few months' time. Bertrand Piccard is sharing the flying duties in the single-seater plane with his business partner, Andre Borschberg. In the past month, Solar Impulse has set two world records for manned solar-powered flight. The first was for the longest distance covered on a single journey - that of 1,468km between Muscat, Oman, and Ahmedabad, India. The second was for a groundspeed of 117 knots (216km/h; 135mph), which was achieved during the leg into Mandalay, Myanmar, from Varanasi, India. No solar-powered plane has ever flown around the world. The Solar Impulse venture does however recall some other recent circumnavigation feats in aviation - albeit fuelled ones. In 1986, the Voyager aircraft became the first to fly around the world without stopping or refuelling. Piloted by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, the propeller-driven vehicle took nine days to complete its journey. Then, in 2005, this time was beaten by the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, which was solo-piloted by Steve Fossett. A jet-powered plane, GlobalFlyer completed its non-stop circumnavigation in just under three days. Solar Impulse has a wingspan of 72m - bigger than that of a 747 jumbo jet airliner - but only weighs 2.3 tonnes. Its four propellers are dependent on the electricity from 17,000 solar cells that line the top of the wings. During the night, the props' motors must call on the excess energy generated and stored during the day in lithium-ion batteries.

The Greek debt crisis is also on the summit's agenda. Greece and its international creditors remain deadlocked after talks on Thursday. Earlier, Mr Tusk called on EU member states to share the burden of the boat loads of illegal migrants who have crossed the Mediterranean. New figures from the UN refugee agency UNHCR show that 63,000 migrants have arrived in Greece by sea this year and 62,000 in Italy. \"Leaders agreed that 40,000 persons in need will be relocated from Greece and Italy to other states over the next two years,\" Mr Tusk told reporters. \"Interior ministers will finalise the scheme by the end of July.\" Leaders also agreed to resettle another 20,000 refugees from outside the EU. The BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Brussels says Hungary, which has seen thousands of migrants cross its border by land, and Bulgaria, one of the EU's poorest countries, have both been granted exemptions. The UK has opted out of the scheme, while nations in eastern Europe refused to accept set quotas, so it will be only voluntary.  This angered Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who called the plan \"modest\". Italy has sought more help from its EU partners to handle the boatloads of migrants. The migrant crisis has been high on the agenda for the EU summit, which opened on Thursday. 153,000 migrants counted on Europe's borders 149% increase from 2014 63,000  migrants reached Greece by sea 62,000 migrants reached Italy by sea 10,000   on Hungary/Serbia border in May Why is EU struggling with migrants and asylum?

More than three million refugees are being housed in countries on Syria's borders - far more than the EU has taken in. But many thousands are also fleeing chaos, violence and dire poverty in Eritrea, Somalia and other countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, the impasse in the Greek debt talks has threatened to overshadow the summit. Only once agreement on economic reforms is reached between Greece and its creditors - the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - will the final \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.2bn tranche of bailout funds be released to Greece. The cash-strapped country must make a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.6bn (\u00c2\u00a31.1bn) IMF debt repayment by Tuesday or face default and a possible exit from the euro. On Thursday, a meeting of eurozone finance ministers also broke up without progress on the issue. It was the fourth time in a week that the Eurogroup had met in an attempt to prevent a Greek debt default. They will meet again on Saturday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that meeting would be \"decisive\" in finding a solution. IMF head Christine Lagarde said lenders had been presented with a counter-proposal by the Greek parties \"at the last hour\" on Thursday and needed more time to assess it, Reuters reported. Also during Thursday's talks, UK Prime Minister David Cameron outlined his plans to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.

{"article": "Qatar's Foreign Minister Khalid al-Attiya set the tone of the Gulf Co-operation Council's Foreign Ministers' meeting with his opening words, saying it was being held in \"very exceptional circumstances and challenges that have been unprecedented\". The main topic of Monday's talks has been the US effort to allay Arab concerns over the 14 July nuclear deal with Iran. Saudi Arabia and its closest allies fear that the deal will make it more, not less, likely, that Tehran will eventually build a nuclear bomb. They also suspect that with up to $150bn (\u00c2\u00a396bn) of newly-unfrozen funds, Iran's more extremist elements will step up their support for militant Shia groups around the region. A separate trilateral meeting between the US, Russian and Saudi foreign ministers has been focusing on Syria. But Gulf Arab governments also have mounting security concerns closer to home. Despite being the most prosperous and stable part of the Arab world, the six Gulf Arab states now find themselves facing a twin threat of domestic terrorist attacks from two ideologically opposed foes: Sunni and Shia extremists. In late July, Bahrain suffered one of the most serious attacks on its police force. An improvised bomb ambushed a police convoy, killing two officers and injuring others. Investigators say the explosive used was of military quality and similar to explosives the authorities say have been intercepted coming from Iran. They believe this latest device came from Shia militants in Iraq, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. Bahrain has long accused Iran - and specifically elements of its intelligence security apparatus - of promoting violent unrest in the island state. Opposition figures say the government has often talked up this threat as a pretext for cracking down on protests and stifling any challenge to the Sunni monarchy by the Shia, who form a majority of the indigenous population. But Western diplomats share Bahrain's concerns, following a number of recent discoveries of explosives and weapons coming in by sea and over the causeway from Saudi Arabia, that Bahrain is being targeted by violent Shia extremists outside the country. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also highly suspicious of Iran's activities in the region, which is why their armed forces have been actively helping Yemeni troops push the allegedly Iranian-backed Houthi rebels out of Aden. But the deadliest terrorist threat in the Gulf right now comes from the Sunni jihadists of so-called Islamic State (IS). In the space of five weeks this summer the Najd Province group, an IS affiliate, carried out three suicide bombings - two in Saudi Arabia and one in Kuwait. In all, 52 people were killed and hundreds injured. In each case the targets were Shia Muslims, murdered in their mosques as they attended Friday prayers. The jihadists of IS consider the Shia to be heretics. Analysts believe the aim of these bombings is to provoke a violent response from the Shia, setting off a sectarian conflict that will recruit more of the Gulf's Sunni citizens into the ranks of IS. After hitting Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, experts believe Bahrain is the next likely target. The numbers of IS supporters in the Gulf is disturbingly high and probably far greater than official figures suggest. In July the Saudi authorities announced they had arrested 431 suspected IS members, on top of a further 93 announced in April. Aymen Deen, the former al-Qaeda operative and expert on IS, believes there has been a recent change of strategy by the militant group. He says that rather than encouraging Gulf Arab supporters to come to Syria, the IS leadership is now telling them to remain in their own countries to plan attacks there, on the authorities, on the Shia and on Westerners.", "question": "If Gulf Arab foreign ministers tell US Secretary of State John Kerry their full list of fears this week then he may need to extend his current visit to Doha .

It adds that the situation is a \"serious concern\", not helped by \"weak law enforcement and judicial systems\", or the country's \"legacy of societal violence\" - a reference to the Guatemalan Civil War that ran from 1960 to 1996. Under such circumstances it is perhaps no surprise that the country's private security sector is booming. \"The demand is always increasing,\" says Alredo Rosenberg, a manager at one such security firm, Sedicop. \"Unfortunately this comes from the problem of insecurity that we all experience as Guatemalans.\" Sedicop is one of almost 100 legally registered private security firms protecting citizens and businesses in Guatemala. A similar number of other security businesses work without government approval. In total, there are estimated to be as many as 150,000 private security guards in the country, compared with a police force of just 30,000. This is in a country with a population of 15.5 million, of which 4.5 million live in and around the capital. Sedicop and its 500 employees offer a range of services. If a business would like to see a shipment safely delivered, Sedicop can send a patrol car to drive with the van or lorry, for a price of $2 (\u00c2\u00a31.50) per km. Want a security guard to watch a business premises? Prices start from $545 a month. Need a bodyguard? That's from $775 a month. \"People will pay for security,\" says Sedicop operations director Hans Castillo. \"That's because it's a person's life we are talking about.\" For fans of US heavy metal band Metallica, the group's 2010 concert in Guatemala City was an incredible night full of crunching guitar riffs and pounding drum solos. But for Julio Colon, the outdoor gig of 27,000 people simply screamed \"security hazard\". Mr Colon, a manager at private security firm Seguridad Integral, was given overall responsibility for the safety of the event. He equipped the football stadium where the concert took place with metal detectors, formulated an exit plan, and ensured that security personnel with walkie-talkies were stationed everywhere. Thankfully the event passed without incident. With people in Guatemala wanting life to go on as normal despite the daily security concerns, concerts and football matches continue to be held in the country. And Seguridad Integral has now provided security at thousands of such events since it was founded in 1990. \"At the time there weren't any companies that specialised in covering large events,\" says Mr Colon. \"Overseeing an event where there is movement of a lot of people in a few hours is very different to just looking after a building.\" While most security firms in Guatemala provide general security services for companies, Seguridad Integral continues to specialise in large events, carving out its own niche. It charges as much as $26,000 per event. Mr Colon says that demand has steadily grown, and that the firm now has 150 employees. Such is the continuing demand in Guatemala for private security firms, that it has attracted entrants from overseas. Ohad Steinhart moved to the country in 1994 to work as a firearms instructor after completing his service in the Israel Defence Forces. About two years later he opened his own private security firm, Decision Ejecutiva, which offers personalised security packages, mainly to Guatemalan, Mexican and American businesspeople. At the time his clients' biggest concern was kidnapping. However, Mr Steinhart says he needs to continue to adapt to an ever-changing security situation in Guatemala. He adds that in recent years there has been a big rise in the number of extortion cases. \"In this country when you close one hole, another two open,\" he says in regard to Guatemalan security issues. Decision Ejecutiva charges from $1,500 per month for a personal bodyguard, and now employs 300 people. While Guatemala now has more than 200 private security firms, Mr Steinhart says there is ample work for all of them. And this situation is not likely to change any time soon. Adriana Beltran, a security expert at US think tank Washington Office On Latin America, says that private security firms are so in demand in Guatemala because people don't believe that the police or other state institutions can protect them. \"Those who can afford it turn to private security firms for protection,\" she says. Back on Avenue Reforma the security guard is still walking back and forth, and doesn't stop to talk. He was hired by a building that has cafes and restaurants at street level, with offices above containing a law firm, travel agent and TV station.

{"article": "But the 75-year-old law professor has played a key role in the impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff. Under Brazil's constitution, he became acting president after the Senate voted in favour of launching an impeachment trial against Ms Rousseff, suspending her. Mr Temer is a discreet politician who seems always to be hovering around the centre of everything important, yet - up until now - never in the spotlight. But recently he has come out of the shadows, as a skilled politician intent on ending the Rousseff presidency and beginning a new era in Brazil. Mr Temer's most notable achievement as a politician has been to help the country's biggest political party - the PMDB - form coalitions with every president in the past two decades. He is currently party president. He presided over Brazil's lower house of Congress during the years of the Fernando Henrique Cardoso government (1995-2002), when Brazil underwent a liberal programme of privatisations and opening-up of the economy. And under Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2002-10, known as Lula) and Ms Rousseff, he has played a key role in helping push forward their Workers' Party agenda of state-led investments. But rather like his party, which has not held outright power for over two decades, Mr Temer has always been a kingmaker, but never king. Both party and man avoid clear ideological positions, which leaves them in a comfortable position for negotiating their participation in coalitions of any political colour. As Brazil's political crisis worsened and Ms Rousseff's Workers' Party bore most of the brunt for the many scandals in the country, the PMDB saw an opportunity to finally seize power. For most of last year, as Ms Rousseff's situation deteriorated, Mr Temer kept a low profile. But in December, things began to change. The then-speaker of Brazil's lower house of Congress, Eduardo Cunha, also a PMDB politician, opened impeachment proceedings against Ms Rousseff for allegedly doctoring government public finances - an allegation the president denies. A few days later, a bitter letter written by Mr Temer to Ms Rousseff was leaked to the press, in which he complained that he had been neglected in making key decisions in the coalition. In March, the PMDB officially abandoned the coalition. In April, the battle between Mr Temer and Ms Rousseff for Brazil's top job finally came out into the open. Mr Temer sent a WhatsApp recording to a few MPs with a draft of the speech he had prepared in case Ms Rousseff lost the 17 April impeachment vote in the lower house. In it, he outlined how Brazil needed a \"government to save the country\". Mr Temer said the message was sent by mistake, but Ms Rousseff accused him of deliberately releasing his speech. Furthermore she accused both Mr Temer and Mr Cunha of being \"chief and vice-chief of a coup\" against her. Both men denied they were conspiring for Brazil's top job. In the days leading to the 17 April vote, both Mr Temer and Ms Rousseff met dozens of lawmakers, with some accounts of tough negotiations of jobs and promises in exchange for votes in Congress from both sides. So what could Brazilians expect now? In October 2015, the PMDB launched a manifesto called Bridge to the Future, which outlined what policies they would defend within the coalition. Most policies are popular with businesspeople and investors and would go a lot deeper into rebalancing Brazil's budget than President Rousseff has done so far - such as creating a minimum age for retirement, changing the scope of social programmes, opening up the oil sector, making labour laws more flexible and cutting mandatory spending in health and education. However, many of those policies are likely to find a lot of resistance. \"It is the type of programme that even a government that was elected by the people with total legitimacy from the vote would have a very hard time approving in the middle of such a big crisis,\" says economist Laura Carvalho, from USP university. \"They will try to push that through and there's going to be a lot of resistance from social movements and labour unions.\" Mr Temer has signalled he may approach the opposition PSDB party to secure a majority in Congress - but that would be a hard sell for many, as the majority of Brazilians rejected the party in the 2014 elections. There are also questions of how Mr Temer would handle corruption investigations, as his party features prominently in many scandals, including the speakers of the Senate, Renan Calheiros, and the former speaker of the lower, Mr Cunha. Mr Cunha was suspended from the post of lower house speaker earlier this month over allegations he tried to obstruct a corruption investigation against him. So far Ms Rousseff has refrained from intervening in the Federal Police and court investigations into alleged corruption at state oil firm Petrobras - even when the scandal caused serious damage to her party. Would Mr Temer do the same? He is not under direct investigation, but Mr Cunha - a powerful ally who has led much of the impeachment process that may benefit Mr Temer in the end - is alleged to hold millions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts. Mr Cunha denies the allegations. There is a public outcry against Mr Cunha, so Mr Temer will be under pressure to turn against him and keep investigations independent. During many occasions throughout the current crisis, Ms Rousseff has stressed that she was elected by 54.5 million Brazilians in 2014 and therefore has legitimacy to lead the country. As her vice-president, Mr Temer indirectly received the same votes. He will now lead the whole nation - even those who until a few weeks back did not even know who he was.", "question": "Until recently most Brazilians would have @placeholder to recognise Michel Temer if they were shown a picture of the vice - president .", "option_0": "returned", "option_1": "vowed", "option_2": "had", "option_3": "struggled", "option_4": "wanted", "label": 3}

{"article": "But which companies have managed to stand out in this important market? The BBC asked global brand research company Millward Brown to find the 20 most powerful foreign brands in China, the ones that have gone in and succeeded where many others have failed. We then asked those companies to tell us the secrets of their success. Between 2011 and 2013, Millward Brown carried out almost 60,000 face-to-face and online interviews with consumers in 10 Chinese cities as part of their market research in the country. The company then analysed its findings for the BBC, ranking brands on how \"meaningful\", \"different\" or \"salient\" they were and how easily they came into consumers' minds. Thirteen of the top 20 brands are from the US, two from Germany, two from France, one from Italy and one from the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever. South Korea's Samsung is the only Asian brand on the list. The opportunity is there for the taking. Millward Brown has found that Chinese consumers once valued low prices above any other factor when making choices. But a mix of higher living standards and falling trust in local brands means people are looking to international brands more. \"Our research shows that in the last three years, trust in Chinese brands has eroded quite dramatically,\" says Millward Brown's Peter Walshe. \"This is an opportunity for well-known and well-supported international brands to make their move as consumers start to value quality and experience as much as price.\" So how do you create a brand that works in China? We asked the companies on our list and 11 of them; Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Nike, L'Oreal, Apple, Samsung, Adidas, Armani, Omo, VW and the number one brand KFC gave us the lowdown on how it's done. All of the brands have been pioneers in China, entering before 2000. Coca-Cola has been there since 1927 and by 1948 was shifting more than a million bottles a year in Shanghai, making it the biggest city for the company outside the US. Nike says it's been there since 1981, VW started in 1983, KFC in 1987 and McDonald's followed in 1990, so getting in early seems to be a key factor. The Chinese market is changing quickly and many of the companies are learning to keep up. \"Everyone is learning about how they need to work with changing social attitudes and continuous aspirational trade-ups, even the Chinese themselves.\" according to McDonald's. \"Never assume what works for your mature markets will work for China. Success comes for those who stay relevant to the needs of the Chinese consumer.\" Other brands, such as Unilever's detergent Omo, go in with a fully researched understanding of the behaviours of consumers. It found that in many markets a family would use three buckets to wash clothes but Chinese consumers used five buckets for their laundry and Omo pitched their brand accordingly. Nike is developing products around Chinese habits and sports, which it then plans to sell in other markets. Giorgio Armani says that when he went into China, he painted the door of the store in Beijing red as he thought it would appeal more to his customers. Now Armani says he doesn't really change his offering in China from other markets as the customers want the Western style he sells internationally. Having got in early, many of the companies are building on that advantage. Some of the numbers are staggering. KFC has 4,400 restaurants in 850 cities and will add another 700 this year. McDonald's says it is opening 10 restaurants a week and during 2012-15 Coca-Cola will invest $4bn expanding in China. But it's not all fast food and fizzy drinks. Apple is doubling the number of stores in China in the next two years. For German carmaker Volkswagen, China is its biggest market, representing a third of its global business and it has seven new production plants in the pipeline. Many of the brands that spoke to us stressed the importance of looking beyond the coastal cities of Shanghai and Beijing to the staggering growth and new consumers in cities across the country. Both Samsung and L'Oreal tailor their approach in China to different regions. Adidas says of the 800 stores it opened in China last year, half of them were in these so-called \"lower-tier\" cities. It has found very different attitudes in the north and the south of the country but says even in inland cities, consumers are increasingly looking to buy aspirational foreign brands. Running a business in China is difficult to do from outside the country, and many of these multinationals tell us that their success is built on finding the best Chinese talent and joint venture partners. KFC, L'Oreal, VW and Adidas all say that hiring and then training the best local talent helps them understand their customers better.", "question": "The masses of new middle - @placeholder consumers in China are one of the big targets for global companies battling the sluggish economies of Europe and North America .", "option_0": "market", "option_1": "style", "option_2": "class", "option_3": "age", "option_4": "level", "label": 2}

{"article": "The company that runs HMP Northumberland insists the prison is under control and says the same number of layoffs would have been had it remained in the public sector. But a series of incidents, since French multinational Sodexo took over in December 2013, have attracted criticism from staff, MPs and union officials. Paul Miller was an officer at the 1,300-capacity Acklington jail for 23 years and picked up awards for his service. \"I loved my job. I loved the banter. I had a great rapport with the prisoners. I was proud to wear the crown on the uniform,\" he said. He, along with about 200 of the 588 staff, took voluntary redundancy earlier this year. The 48-year-old now runs a photo booth business with his wife Julie but he says if the prison had stayed in the public sector, he would have remained in the service. \"I think it's immoral to run this for money,\" he said. \"Why should somebody make profit out of somebody's misfortune?\" Labour MP Ian Lavery, whose Wansbeck constituency is nearby, said he was \"vehemently opposed\" to privatisation of the Prison Service. But the prison was not without shortcomings before the contract was put out to tender. Its last inspection report in 2012 said a third of prisoners were locked up during the working day with nothing to do. This, says Sodexo, is one of the areas in which it is making progress, as it works to fulfil its commitment to bring more work into the prison. But the 2012 report also found the prison was relatively safe and \"respectful\". In a year which saw a group of prisoners take over a wing, a member of staff hospitalised in an assault and a small group of prisoners running riot after fire broke out in six cells, Mr Miller also says one of his friends was headbutted by a prisoner. Mr Lavery said: \"It looks very much as if it's a powder keg. I'm worried a member of staff is going to get seriously harmed.\" It is unclear if there has been a genuine increase in violence, or whether there has simply been greater scrutiny since privatisation. The Ministry of Justice, which holds the figures on the number of assaults, has refused to release them for the period after December 2013. \"Don't get me wrong, it did happen in the Prison Service as well but not in these numbers,\" Mr Miller said. \"We always felt we were good at interacting with the prisoners and there was a lot of respect both ways.\" But he believes there are now too few staff to forge relationships with prisoners and keep control of them. \"When I first went to HMP Northumberland, we had 60 prisoners with a senior officer and five officers running a wing,\" he said. By the time he left, this had dropped to two officers in charge of a wing with no senior officer, he said. Frances Crook, chief executive of campaigning charity the Howard League for Penal Reform, said staffing levels were \"particularly concerning\". She said 2014 had been \"a year to forget\" for the prison. In a statement, Sodexo said it constantly reviewed staffing levels and had hired 27 new officers as a result. Sir Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat MP whose Berwick constituency includes the prison and who is chair of the Justice Committee, said staffing was a concern. But he pointed out that when the HMP Northumberland contract was put out to tender, the public sector bid also included a planned staff reduction of 200. \"I visit a lot of prisons, some of them are public sector, some of them are private sector and there's good and bad in both,\" he said. \"The thing that tends to make prisons not work well is the immediate aftermath of any kind of change. \"There has been a general increase in violence across the prison system and it's clearly affected HMP Northumberland.\" Staff cuts have been made across the board and government figures recently released showed a 15% increase in attacks on officers across the prison system, since the coalition came into power. Sodexo sees some of the criticism it has received over its running of HMP Northumberland as unfair. In a statement, the company said: \"We're disappointed with the negative perception of HMP Northumberland when our experienced staff do fantastic work in a challenging environment. \"Our highest priority is to run a safe prison and this is never an area of compromise. \"Criticism of staffing levels has taken the focus away from HMP Northumberland as a working prison. \"We are committed to reducing reoffending and more prisoners are now working in the prison for longer hours than ever before as part of our resettlement strategy.\" The public will get a sense of the current situation in the jail next month, when inspectors who visited in September publish their report.

That's a source of a great deal of discontent and concern and frustration within the wider republican constituency.\" Meanwhile, DUP MLA Lord Morrow told The View his party would not invite a Sinn F\u00e9in leader to its party conference. \"The difference in an Ulster Unionist conference and a DUP conference is very clear,\" he said. \"We have a party conference; we have an array of speakers from the DUP and we don't have to go out and invite others to come in and fill the space to tickle the emotions of our delegates.\" The View will be broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland on Thursday night at 22:45 BST.", "question": "Sinn F\u00e9in has been accused of turning its back on unionist outreach after its response to the SDLP leader 's @placeholder at the Ulster Unionist conference .", "option_0": "appearance", "option_1": "resignation", "option_2": "riots", "option_3": "body", "option_4": "statements", "label": 0}
{"article": "Who were these men and - 100 years later - has there been a lasting legacy from their deaths? The vast majority of those who drowned or died from hypothermia were South Africans recruited to work as manual labourers on the Western Front. Many had signed up hoping they would win more political freedoms if they demonstrated their willingness to help the British Empire's war effort. The Mendi had already completed a 34-day journey from Cape Town when it sailed past the Isle of Wight in foggy weather on 21 February. At about 05:00 GMT, a Royal Mail packet-boat, the SS Darro, ploughed into the Mendi at full speed, smashing a 20ft (6m) hole on her starboard side. It ripped through to crowded holds where men were sleeping in tightly-packed tiers of bunks. A total of 646 people died. Only 267 survived the sinking; 195 black men, two of the four white officers and 10 of the 17 white NCOs. From the safety of the Darro, Captain Harry Stump stood by and watched - but for reasons that are still murky, did nothing to save the lives of the men. Why didn't he help? The SS Darro sustained only minor damage and there was plenty of room on board, according to the official investigation. Survivors were instead picked up by the destroyer HMS Brisk and then other ships. South African historian Professor Albert Grundlingh, said it was difficult to explain Cpt Stump's actions. \"It's shrouded in mystery,\" he said. \"At a tribunal Cpt Stump said it was dark, and he couldn't see in the conditions. Maybe he was confused or lost his nerve. \"Was is because the men were black? There has certainly been speculation to that effect, but no firm conclusion. In South Africa, people believed that.\" The SANLC was formed in response to a British request for manual workers on the Western Front. The men were to have become part of a huge multinational labour force. Their role was to build the railways, trenches, camps and roads upon which the Allied war effort depended. They were not allowed to bear arms, were kept segregated, and were not eligible for military honours. Following the disaster, bodies continued to be washed up on both sides of the Channel for several weeks. The news of the sinking reached South Africa two weeks after it happened. Prime Minister General Louis Botha rose in parliament to inform the nation, and the house unanimously carried a motion conveying \"parliament's sadness\". Botha praised the labour corps for \"doing everything possible\" in the war and for their \"loyalty to the flag and the King\". This deference did not stretch to awarding medals to any of the black servicemen - living or dead - from the South African Native Labour Force. Such honours were reserved for white officers only. In the years that followed, the disaster was not made much of in South Africa. Indeed, some African National Congress (ANC) leaders viewed war veterans as \"sell-outs\", according to Prof Grundlingh, and felt \"embarrassed\" about black military service. Col Daisy Tshiloane, a former member of the ANC's military wing, said she had learned the story of the Mendi in \"ANC camps\". Speaking as a South African deputy defence advisor in 2014, she said she found it \"very hurtful\" that \"so many black African lives meant nothing\". The story was not included in school curriculums set by the country's white rulers but was passed on from generation to generation, says author Fred Khumalo. \"It's a huge gap in our history,\" says the writer of Dancing the Death Drill, a novel based on the sinking. The book's title comes from an unconfirmed but persistent anecdote about Reverend Isaac Wauchope Dyobha, a pastor on the ship. He was a prominent member of a group of East Cape African intellectuals, who encouraged their compatriots to join the Labour Corps in the hope the show of loyalty would benefit black people politically. The story goes that he told the doomed men: \"Be quiet and calm, my countrymen, for what is taking place now is exactly what you came to do. \"You are going to die, but that is what you came to do. \"Brothers, we are drilling the drill of death. \"I, a Xhosa, say you are all my brothers, Zulus, Swazis, Pondos, Basutos, we die like brothers. \"We are the sons of Africa. \"Raise your cries, brothers, for though they made us leave our weapons at our home, our voices are left with our bodies. He then led them in a barefoot dance - the \"death drill\" - drumming their feet on the deck as the ship wallowed and sank. Historians have varyingly described the legend as \"pure nationalist mythology based on African oral tradition\" or containing a \"solid core of truth\". Other stories of heroism include that of Joseph Tshite, a schoolmaster from near Pretoria, who encouraged those around him with hymns and prayers until he died. A white sergeant was supported by two black compatriots, who swam with him and found place for him on a raft. The site of the wreck was discovered by an English diver in 1974 and an official memorial was erected by the South African government in 1986 at Delville Wood in France. By then, South Africa's black majority had lived under decades of apartheid rule, the hopes that loyalty in WW1 would lead to greater political rights having been long dashed. However, in post-apartheid South Africa, the story is now better known. A Mendi medal for bravery was established in 2003 and a modern South African navy ship bears its name. And the controversy over the actions - or lack of - by Cpt Stump rumbles on. He was found entirely to blame for the sinking. An official report ruled he was going too fast and had not sounded a warning whistle in the fog. According to Prof Grundlingh, the captain never explained why he did not help the stricken men on board the Mendi, nor express any regret or remorse. Yet despite calls for him to be jailed, the only sanction he faced was to have his licence suspended for a year. \"He must have heard the cries proceeding from the water for hours [after the accident],\" the report into the disaster said. \"There was nothing to have prevented him from sending boats on the then smooth water... had he done so, many more lives would have been saved. \"His inaction was inexcusable.\"", "question": "In the pre-dawn darkness of a February morning in 1917 , a ship carrying hundreds of black South African men was sunk in the English Channel .

{"article": "Cologne police also made \"serious mistakes\" in not calling reinforcements and the way they informed the public. More than 500 criminal complaints were filed, 40% alleging sexual assault. Apparent retaliatory attacks in Cologne on Sunday were condemned by the government as inexcusable. The Pope meanwhile said Europe's \"humanistic spirit\" risked being undermined. The \"immense influx\" of migrants was causing problems, he said, but the continent had the means to strike a balance between protecting its citizens and helping migrants. North Rhine-Westphalia state's interior minister Ralf Jaeger said that recent arrivals in Germany were among the suspects in the attacks, which took place in central Cologne, in the area of the cathedral and the main railway station. Nineteen individuals are currently under investigation by the state police in connection with the attacks, NRW's interior ministry says in a report (in German), none of them German nationals. Those 19 suspects include 14 men from Morocco and Algeria. Ten of the suspects are asylum seekers, nine of whom arrived in Germany after September 2015. The other nine are possibly in Germany illegally, the interior ministry says. The scale of the assaults on women in Cologne and other German cities has shocked Germany. Mr Jaeger is himself under political pressure. On Friday he fired Cologne's police chief, Wolfgang Albers. Addressing state MPs on Monday, Mr Jaeger criticised police for not calling for reinforcements on the night, and also for the way they informed the public about the investigation in the days after the events. His report details how a group of around 1,000 men of North African and Arabic origin gathered on 31 December. Smaller groups formed, surrounding women, then threatening and attacking them, he said. These groups were predominately made up of North African men who had travelled to Cologne from different cities. \"After the intoxication with drugs and alcohol came violence,\" said Mr Jaeger. \"It culminated in the acting out of fantasies of sexual omnipotence. That must be severely punished.\" Around 1.1 million asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2015. Chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration policy has come under criticism since the attacks. Riot police used water cannon to disperse anti-migrant protesters in Cologne on Saturday. On Sunday evening, a group of around 20 people attacked six Pakistanis, two of whom had to be treated in hospital. Two Syrian men were attacked in two separate incidents. Three men from Guinea were assaulted in a fourth attack, police said. Crime division chief Norbert Wagner said police were investigating whether the attacks were co-ordinated on social media. Justice Minister Heiko Maas condemned those attacks, saying: \"As abominable as the crimes in Cologne and other cities were, one thing remains clear: there is no justification for blanket agitation against foreigners.\" He said it appeared that some people \"appear just to have been waiting for the events of Cologne\". Mrs Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said \"nothing excuses\" retaliatory assaults on immigrants. Monday's report into the attacks in Cologne says that the combination of group sexual violence with robbery had not previously been seen in Germany. It notes that similar crimes took place in other parts of Germany on 31 December, including in Hamburg. The report describes a modus operandi known as \"taharrush gamea\" in Arabic, meaning group sexual harassment in crowds, and compares it to incidents reported in Cairo's Tahrir Square at the time of the Egyptian revolution.

The passport had to get to customer Hugh Munro in Rye, Sussex, by 09:00 BST the following day so that his planned visit to Amsterdam could go ahead. Mr Shepherd said his instinct was to \"keep the customer happy\". Mr Munro was heading to the Dutch capital for a charity board meeting after stopping off at his sister's house in Rye. Mr Shepherd, who has been postmaster at Stratton Store for 11 months, said: \"I knew it was vital he had it. \"His neighbour brought it in. But it wasn't given to the postman at collection time, so I finished work at 7pm and drove to Exeter to catch the 1am train to London.\" Mr Shepherd drove 50 miles to Exeter; caught the train to London Paddington; took the Tube to St Pancras; a further train to Ashford, Kent; and a final train to Rye.

{"article": "Today could be just another day he may have felt the same, as events moved with dizzying speed. First, it was the news that the government had reassigned 350 police officers in the capital Ankara to different posts (mostly demotions) by a government decree published at midnight. They included chiefs of financial crimes, anti-smuggling, cybercrime and organised crime units. This was followed by other breaking news - a simultaneous corruption operation in five cities across Turkey, with more than 25 people, businessmen and state officials, detained on suspicion of bribery and fraudulent tenders. Then the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK), which appoints senior members of the judiciary, decided to investigate Istanbul's newly appointed police chief and several prosecutors overseeing the corruption probe started in December last year. Later, the top police officers in charge of the operation conducted earlier in the day were dismissed from their posts. An opposition MP called for the president to intervene in the crisis. A former Turkish president had once famously said \"24 hours is a very long time in politics\". Even he probably could not have predicted such a day. All these moves come as the AKP government led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan tries to contain the massive political fallout from the corruption probe into four government ministers, several businessmen and bankers. This has become the biggest challenge to the AKP government's 11-year rule and Mr Erdogan has been quick to retaliate, condemning the probe as a \"dirty plot\" to topple his government. Mr Erdogan said he would not permit \"a state within a state\", a phrase apparently referring to the movement led by the highly influential Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the US since 1999. Mr Gulen is said to have millions of followers across the world and extensive influence over the state bureaucracy, the police force and the judiciary in Turkey. The government accuses him and his movement, referred to as \"Cemaat\" in Turkey, of being behind the graft probe - a charge Mr Gulen denies. However, the recent crisis in Turkey is increasingly seen as not only a corruption investigation which is alleged to involve the closest circles of Mr Erdogan, but a bitter power struggle between AKP and Cemaat. Some believe that Cemaat's support was crucial in the election victories of AKP for three consecutive terms; that they have helped the government in curbing the powers of the military by their influence within the judiciary with the help of high-profile cases like Ergenekon and Sledgehammer which saw hundreds of military officers - including the previous chief of staff of the armed forces - jailed; that as the \"common enemy\" was driven out of the picture they started to become wary of each other's power and hence a fight for holding the ropes of Turkey started. Many commentators in Turkey label the recent fallout as a \"state crisis\" since the government is perceived to be intervening in the judiciary, and the principle of separation of powers does not seem to be as intact as it should in a democracy. On the other hand, Cemaat is not a transparent movement; no-one knows the extent of its financial power, how many millions of followers it has, how influential it is in key offices within Turkish state and what would happen if it gained further influence. Neither does anyone know who might win this full-scale battle: Mr Erdogan or Mr Gulen. Supporters of both sides accuse each other of undermining democracy and the rule of law; the media has become increasingly polarised with either pro-Erdogan or pro-Gulen voices leaving little space for others and the Turkish public increasingly feeling as if they are watching a fierce tennis match, holding their breaths. Recently, it was alleged that there could be detente between Mr Erdogan and Mr Gulen through a letter Mr Gulen sent to the president of the country. But that option does not seem to be on the table any more. Now there is speculation that there might soon be an investigation into Cemaat, with accusations it is a \"terrorist organisation\". On the other hand there is a possibility that people affiliated to Cemaat could leak new allegations involving influential people close to the government. With the local elections in two months time, a presidential election this summer and a general election next year; with Turkish lira falling to a record low against the dollar and the foreign investors watching events nervously, many people in Turkey fear the path ahead with bitter power struggles, may cause political and economic instability in the country.", "question": "Benjamin Harvey , Bloomberg 's Istanbul bureau chief , recently tweeted : \" Considering unfollowing Turkish politics completely on mental health @placeholder . \"", "option_0": "grounds", "option_1": "concerns", "option_2": "topics", "option_3": "advice", "option_4": "information", "label": 0}

{"article": "Australia's Channel Nine said reporter Tara Brown and three colleagues faced four charges, including kidnapping. Five people arrested alongside them - including the children's Australian mother - have also been charged. The mother, Sally Faulkner, says her estranged Lebanese husband moved the children to Lebanon without permission. Channel Nine said it had been \"seeking to highlight\" cross-border custody disputes. The Australian journalists and Ms Faulkner were detained by Lebanese police on Thursday along with two British employees of the UK-based company Child Abduction Recovery International (CARI), and two Lebanese men, officials said. On Tuesday, the official National News Agency reported that Mount Lebanon's Attorney General, Claude Karam, had filed charges, including participating in an abduction, against the nine suspects and referred to the case to an investigating magistrate. CCTV footage broadcast by Lebanese TV appears to show six-year-old Lahala and four-year-old Noah being bundled into a car by several men on a busy street in southern Beirut on Wednesday morning. They had been heading to school with a domestic worker and their paternal grandmother, who says she was knocked to the ground during the abduction. On Saturday, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told reporters that diplomats had been in touch with Lebanese officials and were providing consular assistance to Ms Faulkner and the TV crew. \"Given the sensitivities of this case and the fact children are involved, we are handling this very carefully,\" she said. Channel Nine has refused to say whether it paid CARI to recover the children for Ms Faulkner. However, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday cited Lebanese officials as saying they had a signed statement from a member of the \"recovery team\" saying the network had paid A$115,000 ($88,100; \u00c2\u00a361,600). Channel Nine said in a statement: \"It is extremely important to stress that we are severely limited in what we can say given that matters are now part of a legal process in Lebanon. We are co-operating fully with the Lebanese authorities and it is important to stress that we respect the laws of Lebanon and its judiciary. \"Regrettably a number of inaccurate media reports are exacerbating the concern and confusion of the families of those being detained.\" A Lebanese judicial official told the Associated Press news agency that the investigating magistrate would gather testimony from the suspects beginning on Tuesday. The magistrate would explore whether Ms Faulkner had custody of the children under Australian law, which might serve as a mitigating factor, the official said. The custody dispute between Ms Faulkner and her ex-husband, Ali Elamine, has reportedly been going on for several years. She says he took the children to Lebanon for a holiday last year but did not return. Mr Elamine told Lebanese media that Ms Faulkner and Australian security agencies knew he was leaving Australia with the children and denied kidnapping them. He also revealed that he did not plan to sue his former wife, explaining: \"She is the mother of my children... if I were her I would have done the same.\" Lebanon is not party to the Hague Convention, a treaty designed to ensure the swift return of children abducted internationally by a parent.", "question": "Prosecutors in Lebanon have filed charges against an Australian TV crew @placeholder over an attempt to abduct two children in a custody dispute .", "option_0": "erupted", "option_1": "comments", "option_2": "held", "option_3": "involved", "option_4": "renewed", "label": 2}

Mr Privert said Haiti was facing a \"major food crisis\" and worsening levels of malnutrition. He urged governments around the world to do more to help. Hurricane Matthew ripped through Haiti on 4 October. The Category 4 storm, the strongest to hit the Caribbean in a decade, devastated large parts of the country and affected 2.1 million people. The Haitian government estimates 1.5 million people are in need of immediate assistance, including more than 140,000 people who are living in temporary shelters. Speaking from his home in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, Mr Privert said that he \"didn't want to see Haitian people die because of the unavailability of international assistance\". The president warned that without immediate financial support to replant crops destroyed by Hurricane Matthew, Haiti's situation could worsen further. \"If we don't manage to re-launch agriculture then in three to four months we'll find ourselves with a major food crisis,\" he told the BBC. \"Our projection is that we need between $25m (\u00c2\u00a320m) and $30m to resolve the farming issue.

Haiti has experienced three years of drought before the hurricane so there were already high levels of malnutrition. \"Now tens of thousands of acres of crop land and millions of fruit trees have been destroyed,\" J/P HRO's chief executive Ann Lee said.

{"article": "The New Democratic Party (NDP) ended the Progressive Conservatives' (PC) 44-year rule of the province. Political observers were stunned by the result, with one commentator saying: \"Pigs do fly\". Alberta's Premier Jim Prentice, a former member of Tory Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet, said he was stepping down from political life. He only became premier in September, and called the snap election in April to seek a mandate after bringing in a tough tax-raising budget. \"My contribution to public life is now at an end,\" Mr Prentice said as he conceded defeat, blaming the collapse in oil prices and the subsequent financial problems. Alberta witnessed a political earthquake last night. The major oil producing province in Canada, it has been the country's major economic engine for several years. However, the precipitous drop in the price of oil created a $7bn hole in the province's finances. Prentice decided to base his campaign on a budget that increased taxes/fees (except for corporations), slightly cut government spending and ran a $5bn deficit. However, this budget angered many Albertans and they responded by electing Notley who campaigned on a very different vision. Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley called the surprising win \"a fresh start for our great province\". The result could be seen as a warning to Mr Harper, a Conservative, with a general election looming in October. \"I look forward to working with future Premier Notley on issues of importance for Albertans and all Canadians, including creating jobs, economic growth and long-term prosperity across the province and country,\" Mr Harper said in a statement on Wednesday.

{"article": "Eamon Bradley, 28, from Melmore Gardens in Creggan is accused of receiving weapons training at a rebel camp in Syria in 2014. He was arrested after returning home later. On Wednesday, the jury at Londonderry Crown Court was read transcripts of his interviews with the police. He told police after training with a rebel faction called the Army of Islam he took part in three battles, two against government forces and one against ISIS near the city of Aleppo. But he said he never used his AK47 or grenade on the battlefield. He became disillusioned with the fighting and returned home. Earlier, the trial heard that Mr Bradley contacted people on social media to help him get into the country to join the rebellion. Mr Bradley, a Muslim convert, denies six charges, including attending a rebel training camp in Syria and receiving training in guns and grenades. The case is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland. Mr Bradley told police he got a bus from Derry to Dublin in February 2014 after meeting a contact on Facebook. He then flew to Istanbul and got a second internal flight to Adana, in southern Turkey, where he made contact with sympathizers through the mobile messaging service, WhatsApp. He told detectives he travelled near the Turkey/Syria border but he was warned to go no further because it was controlled by so-called ISIS. Mr Bradley said he stayed with a man in a nearby village who he believed had contacts with the Free Syrian Army. Asked why he was travelling to Syria and if he had any concerns, he told detectives: \"I just wanted to be among the people who were being bombed\". He added that he had no concerns because he \"trusted in Allah\". Mr Bradley said he spent about two months in the village before a group of men, who claimed to have been held captive by ISIS, helped him cross into Syria on a makeshift raft. He then joined a mountain training camp belonging to the group Jaysh al-Islam - the Army of Islam. Detectives were told that it was here that he learned to fire AK-47 rifles and Russian machine guns; he also received some instruction on the use of mortar bombs. Mr Bradley told police that he was the only western European at the camp and was on the bottom rung of the ladder when it came to the group's command structure.

{"article": "Bananas were a staple then - for family consumption and as a mainstay of the local economy - and they still are today. But the 50,000 or so people who live in this hilly district of small trading centres and scattered homesteads have been part of a high-profile aid initiative over the past nine years. It is one of the locations across Africa chosen by the US economist Jeffrey Sachs to establish Millennium Villages - intended to be a model for accelerating the end of global poverty. The Millennium Villages concept has been backed by the United Nations, preparing a string of summits this year as the world marks a transition from the Millennium Development Goals to broader and more ambitious Sustainable Development Goals. The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, says the Millennium Villages are \"showcasing how effective an integrated strategy for education, health care, agriculture and small business can be\". It is when you reach the ridge where Ruhiira's main trading centre has developed that you get a sense of how the area is changing. Clustered around a crossroads, there are now several small grocery stores, shops selling medicines, hardware stores and eating places. There is a bar with a well-used billiards table on the veranda. There are shops where you can draw money with a mobile phone. And there is a co-operative bank with customers queuing up for loans but, for now, with all too little capital to meet the demand. There was scarcely any electricity in this area a few years ago. Then solar power started to make an appearance and now the grid is extending into the area too. A large water tank at the Ruhiira trading centre - fed by piped water - shows progress, too, in the critical area of providing more people with access to clean and safe water. Mr Sachs said that at the peak, the Ruhiira project was investing around $60 (\u00a340) per person per year on health, education, water, sanitation, agriculture etc. (Source: Millennium Village project) Life in a town called Mongo The funding is due to drop down to zero by the end of this year. But Mr Sachs believes even modest resources, if very well directed, can make a \"huge\" difference. But the Ugandan government is stepping up its spending in the area, with the help of some funding from Islamic Development Bank and they are negotiating with other agencies. Some people say they have seen far-reaching change in their lives during the period of the Millennium Village project. Take Robert Nkunda, a 35-year-old farmer. He has been able to build a more substantial home and has wooden sheds for his livestock. In the fields around he grows maize, bananas, coffee and beans. But he could have felt that he had no future in this part of Uganda. \"My father died when I was still very young,\" he says. \"We didn't have enough land. Only a plot where we lived. \"That is the reason I didn't go far in education. But I worked hard to buy this land where I am farming.\" He hopes his children won't forget the land. In the past many children used to drop out of primary school - girls, in particular. Nyakamuri primary school packs 580 children into its single storey classrooms - one of which is now a solar-powered computer room. The head teacher, Florence Kakiiza, describes the everyday challenges her pupils face: \"Most of them have to walk long distances,\" she says. \"They don't have light to do homework and most don't have enough food at home. \"It is still a struggle but we are moving a bit on education\u2026 nearly every child is going to school.\" Ms Kakiiza says one of the biggest challenges in education now is to see more girls in impoverished rural areas like this going to - and staying in - secondary school. \"Most rural girls still drop out of secondary schools,\" she says. \"They get married when they are very young. They have many children from as early as 14.\" The Community Health Workers who now provide a \"front line\" of health care across the Millennium Village area include family planning in the advice they give to villagers as they do their rounds - on bicycles. But where they appear to have had most success is in helping in the effort to bring down once notoriously high levels of child and maternal mortality. They have modern technology on hand for this - carrying smartphones with a special app to feed in data when they visit a pregnant mother or a newborn infant. The Ugandan government has been investing about $8 per person in the health sector of the country, says David Siriri, a development expert working for the government. \"We came with a proposal that we invest at least $30... If the government mobilised its resources and prioritised it well that money can be got\". He said one thing already translated into policy at the national level is that the government is willing to pay more to doctors in rural, hard-to-reach areas. This helps to keep them working there, and is already happening and paying dividends in Ruhiira, he added. Critics of the Millennium Villages maintain they have achieved little in narrowing deeply rooted inequality, which is often exacerbated by the amount of land people have. Project officials argue that they are showing the way to reducing inequality - and that progress is as much about changing mindsets as it is about aid. The Millennium Voice radio station in Ruhiira airs villagers' concerns and offers advice and help. The Millennium Village projects have provoked much debate. They will clearly prove their value by whether their achievements are sustained and shared by everyone - and are taken up elsewhere.", "question": "As you climb up the winding reddish - @placeholder gravel road to Ruhiira - past endless dense plantations of matoke bananas - it can feel at first sight as if it is a world largely unchanged from when I was first working in Uganda close to 50 years ago .", "option_0": "sided", "option_1": "trained", "option_2": "based", "option_3": "coloured", "option_4": "launched", "label": 3}
{"article": "He was talking about the retailer's efforts to drive its stores upmarket and \"elevate its retail proposition\". The idea is to give more space over to branded goods and showcase their \"very best products\", even opening gyms in some of the flagship stores. And on Thursday it announced a \"strategic partnership\" with upmarket Japanese sportswear brand Asics, whose products will be stocked in Asics-managed areas of flagship stores from next year. Sports Direct described this as \"an important step in Sports Direct's journey to being recognised as the Selfridges of sport.'\" Well, there was only one way to find out what this was all about - take a visit to its flagship store on London's Oxford Street, which is showcasing the latest approach. As I walked through the door, to be greeted by thumping music,  I dredged through my memory for the last time I'd been in a Sports Direct. It was a long time ago, but my memory was of the slightly claustrophobic feel of fighting through a crowded jumble of kit and equipment, and my perception, right or wrong, that this was an environment aimed primarily at men. So the fact that the Oxford Street store felt light and airy with plenty of space between rails was a welcome relief. But let's be honest, I'm not a typical Sports Direct customer. Yes, I exercise regularly, but fashion is not foremost in my mind when I'm struggling through another tortuous workout, and I think of Sports Direct as being more about fashion than \"serious\" sport. Could I be converted? Well, first off, reinforcing my prejudice that this is more of a male environment, the first thing you see as you walk through the door of the Oxford Street store is a display of club strips and a sign proclaiming this is \"The Home of Football\",  a reminder that another of Sports Direct's stated aims is to become just that - the home of football. And most of the customers did seem to be male. Of course, a key element of shopping is how the staff treat you. Would I be made to feel welcome? As I wandered aimlessly, an assistant did offer to help me, so a big tick there. What would happen if I tried to buy something. New boxing gloves. Could I get an assistant to advise me? Yes, as it turned out. A smiley young woman confidently explained the point of the different glove weights. OK, once I'd said I would buy them she tried to sell me a special offer on some \"workout make up\" but was quite happy when I said I'd think about it. So how about trying to buy something for my sartorially conservative husband? On the floor below there was no price on the black T-shirt I chose. But another assistant spent a good few minutes checking out the price on the website. Ticks all round for my experience of the staff I came up against, anyway. So then I waylaid shoppers as they left the store to gauge their reactions. Rory Bryant, a teacher who used to work in advertising, had come into buy some socks. He had spotted the shift upmarket and was impressed by the lighter feel, \"compared to most Sports Direct stores\". \"Most are a jumble of crumpled socks and piles of clothing,\" he says. Photographers' agent James Denton, 49, had been in the Oxford Street store for the first time. He came out with a football for his two-year old son. He said he normally thought of the chain as a slightly downmarket depressing experience. \"so it definitely feels different\". \"Stuff is a lot better laid out, they've put a lot of thought into design and layout of everything,\" he added. Another customer, Philip Yardy, described the design of the shops as \"open, appealing\" and encouraging people to walk through. But Stuart Deveson wasn't quite so happy. He spent all of 10 seconds in there, he said. He agreed the entrance to the shop \"looks quite nice\", but said the reason he had walked out so quickly was because he'd gone in to buy shorts and couldn't find them. \"If they're not going to make it easy to find what I want, I'll go somewhere else,\" he said. Sports Direct now has more than 25 new generation stores, of which 12 are \"flagship\" outlets. It plans to open between 16 and 24 new stores in the current financial year, of which about half will be flagship stores. So is Sports Direct \"smashing it out of the park\" with its \"Selfridges of Sport\" concept? Financial analysts seem happy enough with how it's going. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said this had been a \"transformational\" year for Sports Direct. Progress was being made on the new premium stores, he said, and they were \"a lot more profitable than the existing Sports Direct stores\". Initial impressions from the shoppers I spoke to at least do seem positive. Perhaps the last word should go to customer Rory Bryant, who compared the Oxford Street flagship with another retail success story. He said it was now \"more like Niketown up the road\", and perhaps that, as much as Selfridges, is the inspiration behind the chain's makeover.", "question": "\" It 's clear we have smashed the ball out of the park with our ' Selfridges ' of sport concept , \" boasted Sports Direct chief executive Mike Ashley to financial analysts , following the release of the company 's latest @placeholder .", "option_0": "acquisition", "option_1": "body", "option_2": "media", "option_3": "results", "option_4": "team", "label": 3}
{"article": "There's a growing realisation that offshore decommissioning is now really happening. Over the next 25 years or so, the process of retiring North Sea oil and gas facilities could cost tens of billions of pounds, according to projections. But while that is a cost for the operators of the more than 600 oil and gas installations in the North Sea it is an opportunity for firms which can develop the safest and most cost-effective ways forward. It could also mean hundreds of new jobs requiring a new kind of expertise in the coming decades. A major industry event - Decom Offshore 2015 - has been running at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre. The event is run by Decom North Sea (DNS), which was created in 2009, the representative body for the offshore decommissioning industry. DNS chairman Callum Falconer said: \"We are cutting our teeth. There's a sudden realisation that decommissioning is upon us. \"Decommissioning used to be seen as the beginning of the end. Now it's seen as the beginning.\" \"One challenge is that we have to make sure the workforce comes together. \"There's an opportunity for young graduates and engineers to carve out a career in decommissioning.\" Mr Falconer highlighted work that is under way on a new decommissioning learning portal for the industry, to share ideas, which he predicted would be a \"game changer\". One of the major decommissioning plans already in the pipeline is for the iconic Brent field, off Shetland, which operated by Royal Dutch Shell. The oil field lends its name to the benchmark for setting oil prices in the North Sea - Brent Crude. Shell has four platforms in the field but only one of them, Brent Charlie, still produces oil. DNS chief executive Nigel Jenkins outlined five key areas of decommissioning focus - driving collaboration, efficiency, getting the supply chain ready, innovation, and delivering benefits. Mr Jenkins said: \"Collaboration is key due to the interconnected nature of the industry, and the need to share knowledge. \"Decommissioning on this scale has not happened before. \"Particularly for this region, for Aberdeen, we need to make this area is a centre of excellence, a place where the right sort of expertise is available.\" He explained there had been about 10 major decommissioning projects in the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) over the past 20 years, and there was now set to be a \"ramp up\" in such activity. He said it was difficult to predict potential job numbers, but highlighted that Shell's Brent decommissioning project has hundreds of people working on it. Mr Jenkins said: \"There are so many influences over when a project will happen, including age, oil left in a field, and the price of oil. \"That equation is different for every operator.\" He said: \"This conference has shown what a great pool of talent there is to address the challenges. There is a positive feeling. \"We're at the beginning of the market. We are at a point of seismic change.\" Shell's current work is not the first decommissioning project from the Brent field. Twenty years ago, the Brent Spar got international coverage over Shell plans to dump the oil storage module in the deep waters of the North Atlantic. Protesters from Greenpeace occupied it for several days in 1995 and Shell was forced to alter its plans. Brent Spar was instead towed to Norway and moored in a fjord, before being broken up. Although the first stage of this fresh wave of plans - using a giant ship to remove the top of platforms in a single lift - is unlikely to prompt controversy on that scale, there is little doubt the second phase will be the subject of closer scrutiny. This involves contaminated concrete oil storage tanks, which sit on the seabed next to the platform's legs. This challenging new chapter in the North Sea story is well and truly under way.", "question": "As a growing number of North Sea oil and gas fields head towards the end of their production lives , industry leaders are waking up to the challenges - and opportunities - that lie ahead .

He was part of England's squad for the Rugby World Cup, in which they were eliminated at the group stage, and played in the hosts' crucial 28-25 defeat by Wales.

{"article": "It said such policies offer \"poor value for money\". \"Firms must start putting consumers first, and stop seeing them as pound signs,\" said Christopher Woolard, director of policy at the FCA. The insurance industry rejected the accusations, calling some of them unhelpful. Add-on insurance is where a policy is sold alongside another product. For example, customers buying a mobile phone, or a holiday, are often offered insurance at the same time. Nearly 3,000 consumers have complained about such policies in the past nine months. The FCA found that a quarter of customers buying them were unaware that they could get similar products elsewhere. And more than half of such customers did not compare the different policies available. The FCA judged add-on policies by their \"claims ratio\". This measures the proportion of the initial cost of a product that is eventually paid out under the policy. In the case of add-on personal accident insurance it found that the claims ratio was just 9%. In the case of Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) policies - often sold with cars - it found that just 10% of the full value was returned to claimants. In comparison, regular household or motor insurance policies paid out 64% of the original purchase price. As a result, the FCA said many consumers may be paying for policies which are poor value. But the industry said the claims ratio was not a good way of measuring performance. \"The emphasis upon claims ratios is unhelpful; they are not an accurate benchmark of customer value, not least because they are affected by distribution costs for the insurer,\" said Hugh Savill, the director of regulation at the Association of British Insurers.

{"article": "Edward Snowden, 29, checked out from his hotel on Monday and his whereabouts are unknown, but he is believed to be still in Hong Kong. Earlier, he said he had an \"obligation to help free people from oppression\". His leaks led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data. The programme, known as Prism, is run by the US National Security Agency (NSA). The Office of the Director of National Intelligence gave details of the programme last week after Mr Snowden's leaks led to a series of articles in the Guardian and Washington Post newspapers. According to the office's statement, Prism is simply an internal computer system, and not a data-mining programme. Profile: Edward SnowdenCould Hong Kong shelter Snowden?Q&A: Prism and privacy However, such data seizures could break the laws of other countries, and could also break US law if they accidentally capture communications of US citizens. Hong Kong's broadcaster RTHK said Mr Snowden checked out of the Mira hotel in Kowloon on Monday, and Reuters news agency quoted hotel staff as saying that he had left at noon. Ewen MacAskill, one of the Guardian journalists who broke the story, told the BBC he believed Mr Snowden was still in Hong Kong. It is believed the US is pursuing a criminal investigation, but no extradition request has yet been filed. The Chinese territory has an extradition treaty with the US, although analysts say any attempts to bring Mr Snowden to America may take months and could be blocked by Beijing. A petition posted on the White House website calling for Mr Snowden's immediate pardon has gathered more than 30,000 signatures. World media fume However, an opinion poll commissioned by the Washington Post suggests a majority of Americans think government monitoring of phone records is acceptable if the aim is to fight terrorism. Mr Snowden's revelations have led to allegations that the UK's electronic surveillance agency, GCHQ, used the US system to spy on British citizens. Foreign Secretary William Hague cancelled a trip to Washington to address the UK parliament on Monday and deny the claims. The journalists involved in the story were first contacted by Mr Snowden at the start of the year. Filmmaker Laura Poitras told Salon Magazine how Mr Snowden sent her an email saying: \"I want to get your encryption key and let's get on a secure channel. \"I have some information in the intelligence community, and it won't be a waste of your time.\" Ms Poitras ultimately filmed the interview with two Guardian reporters. Mr Snowden told the journalists: \"The NSA has built an infrastructure that allows it to intercept almost everything. With this capability, the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested without targeting. \"I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things. I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.\" Booz Allen Hamilton confirmed in a statement Mr Snowden had been an employee for less than three months. US leaks that shook the world What can you learn from phone records? Just how much do the spooks know? \"If accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm,\" the statement said. The first of the leaks came out on Wednesday night, when the Guardian reported a US secret court had ordered phone company Verizon to hand over to the NSA millions of records on telephone call \"metadata\". The metadata include the numbers of both phones on a call, its duration, time, date and location (for mobiles, determined by which mobile signal towers relayed the call or text). Under the Prism system, officials apply to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court (Fisa) to gain access to communications. Officials are obliged to show the Fisa court that any \"target\" is outside of the US, and there is a \"foreign intelligence purpose\" for the seizure, such as terrorism or nuclear proliferation. However, details of such targets and subsequent requests made to US technology companies are secret. On Thursday, the Washington Post and Guardian said the NSA tapped directly into the servers of nine internet firms including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo to track online communication in a programme known as Prism. All the internet companies denied giving the US government \"direct access\" to their servers, and said they had never heard of the Prism programme. But in separate statements the firms variously said they complied with lawful requests to supply information on an individual basis. Prism was authorised under changes to US surveillance laws passed under President George W Bush, and renewed last year under Barack Obama.

Unesco's loss of $80m (\u00c2\u00a350m) a year in US funding has forced it to pare back American-led initiatives, including Holocaust education and a project to restore water facilities in Iraq. Paris-based Unesco is charged with designating World Heritage sites, promoting education and supporting press freedom, as well as countering extremism. The American ambassador to Unesco, David Killion, told Reuters news agency: \"We intend to continue our engagement with Unesco in every possible way.\" The US, however, has said it cannot legally contribute to a UN agency that implies recognition of a Palestinian state. Israel's ambassador to Unesco, Nimrod Barkan, told the Associated Press news agency that his country supported the US decision, \"objecting to the politicisation of Unesco, or any international organisation, with the accession of a non-existing country like Palestine\". The Palestinian ambassador to Unesco, Elias Sanbar, said other countries were beginning to make up for the funding vacuum left by the US. But he added: \"Is this in the interest of the US, to be replaced?\" The US suspension comes amid attempts by Washington to broker peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

Ms Park is accused of allowing her friend, Choi Soon-sil, to manipulate power from behind the scenes. Hundreds of thousands rallied on Saturday to demand her resignation. South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted officials as saying Ms Park's questioning should take place no later than Wednesday. Prosecutors have also questioned top bosses at Samsung, Hyundai and Korean Air. Lee Jae-Yong, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, was questioned over whether Ms Park pressured the company into donating millions to foundations controlled by her friend Ms Choi. Ms Choi is accused of trying to extort huge sums of money from South Korean companies and is under arrest on charges of fraud and abuse of power. She is suspected of using her friendship with Ms Park to solicit business donations for a non-profit fund she controlled. The president, whose approval ratings have plummeted to 5% because of the scandal, has said she is \"heartbroken\". On Saturday, organisers said some one million people encircled the presidential compound in the South Korean capital of Seoul, in the largest anti-government rally the country has seen. It was the latest in weeks of demonstrations against Ms Park. On Sunday, the presidential office said Ms Park was \"earnestly considering ways to normalise state affairs\" and that she had \"heard the voices of the people at the rally\". She apologised earlier in November for putting \"too much faith in a personal relationship\". \"Sad thoughts trouble my sleep at night.

As the climax approaches, we caught up with series creator and writer Jed Mercurio to give him an AC-12 style interrogation. Is it true a sixth series is not confirmed? We definitely have a fifth, not a sixth... but we haven't started working on it yet. I need to think what the character is first. Did you instantly think of Thandie Newton for the role of DCI Roz Huntley or were other people in the running? It just evolved. I don't normally think of a specific actor, I concentrate on the character and then when we get into pre-production that's how names come up. I always knew Thandie was top talent, she was a real laugh on set. It was the easiest casting process I've ever been through. Did Thandie's status as a Hollywood star have an impact? We were flattered she wanted to do the role - most of her career she's been doing  Hollywood movies so it was a boost for the whole team. How do you come up with the plots for Line of Duty? I come up with the story ideas on my own. I like to sit at my desk... sometimes I get inspiration when I'm going about my normal day-to-day life. Then when I've come up with some sort of story, I get the editorial team on board and we try to develop it. I then write an outline of the first episode which takes about a week. Only when we are happy with the first episode do we start on the second. Can we expect any surprises for the final episode? (pauses, laughs) You will just have to watch! How do real-life police officers react to the plot? One of our intelligence advisers for the show said his team have been trying to crack who balaclava man is - it's quite funny. What would you like to explore in the next series? I want to look at the personal lives of all the regulars in series five - they've taken a backseat in this series to Roz Huntley, so it would be good to explore that side of things a bit more. The regulars are definitely up for doing more... that's if they survive the final episode! What's more important, ratings or awards? I always try and distinguish between facts and opinions. I am just pleased the show is being watched. Ratings are the most important thing. What advice do you have for budding crime series writers? Just write, write, write. Watch lots of shows and films in that genre. Read lots and think about story and characters. Are you tempted to write over in the US? I actually went over there for a while when my career was quiet over in the UK. I wrote pilots for shows over there for about five years.

{"article": "Standing next to his wife, Jani, at a press conference at the Idaho National Guard headquarters, Robert Bergdahl looked like a tribal elder - or as close as one can find in Boise. He wore a beaded necklace and had a long beard. It was trimmed in a style that is popular among Haqqani militants, a group who had reportedly held his son captive in Pakistan near the Afghanistan border. While his wife, Jani, spoke at the podium about their son, he tugged at his beard and fought back tears. \"I'm proud of how much you wanted to help the Afghan people,\" Bergdahl said, addressing his son directly. He told the journalists in the room that central Idaho looks like Afghanistan, since both places have rugged mountains and harsh terrain. The land is beautiful and \"heart-breaking\", he said. \"It makes you tough.\" For years his own toughness has been tested, as he watched Taliban-produced videos of his son. Then on Saturday, Bergdahl heard the good news directly from US President Barack Obama - his son was free. Kidnappings have become a distressingly common occurrence over the past several decades, used by militants to raise cash or to send a political message. Family members usually stay behind the scenes and hope that government officials, special forces or hired experts will help their loved ones. \"Families are told to keep things quiet because you don't want to upset the process,\" says Marvin Weinbaum, a former Pakistan analyst for the US State Department. The kidnapping and release of Sgt Bergdahl has been marked by controversy, however, and by his father's forthright approach to the ordeal. According to media accounts, Sgt Bergdahl left his military outpost in Afghanistan in June 2009 and then was seized by Taliban militants. Some call him a deserter.  At this point, the full story of his kidnapping is not known. Years ago, a military official told me that he and others were trying hard to get Bergdahl released, but that they could only go so far in their efforts. \"The US does not negotiate with kidnappers,\" he explained. In fact, US officials were trying in private to hammer out a deal with the Taliban. Negotiations over Bergdahl went on for years, leading to an exchange - him for five Taliban detainees held at Guantanamo, a decision that has led to criticism from Republicans. Source: James JF Forest's Global Trends in Kidnapping Even when kept under wraps, the discussions were delicate. Yet the father did not stay quiet. He spoke frequently with US officials - and with the Taliban, though indirectly. In a video released on YouTube in May 2011, he was shown in front of a mountain, thanking the Haqqanis and others \"who have cared for our son\". It was part of a bold, and sometimes bizarre, strategy to get his son back. \"This man didn't play by the usual rules,\" says Mr Weinbaum. \"Whether or not that actually brought about his son's release, you can't know for sure,\" he says. \"But it certainly kept the sergeant at the forefront.\" Robert Bergdahl hardly fits the profile of a high-stakes negotiator. He is an unusual man even by mountain standards, a culture that celebrates those who live \"off the grid\". He lives at the end of a dirt road in Hailey (population 7,000), in a house crammed with books. For years he worked as a deliveryman for United Parcel Service. \"He is personable,\" says his friend Sue Martin,  owner of Zaney's River Street Coffee House. Years ago she hired his son to make lattes. A photo of Sgt Bowe, clean-faced and serious in his army beret, now sits on the counter next to a jar of biscotti and a Magic 8 Ball, a toy that makes predictions. She says customers would pick up the Magic 8 Ball and all ask the same question. \"It was always, 'When is Bowe coming home?', not, 'Is he?\"' she says. \"There's not been a doubt expressed.\" Today the town is filled with yellow balloons and signs that say \"Bowe Is Free at Last\". People here rallied behind Robert Bergdahl, even when he said provocative things. After his son was seized, Bergdahl dove into a study of Pashto and the politics of the militants. Last month he sent out a tweet directed to a Taliban leader saying he was \"working to free all Guantanamo prisoners\". He added: \"God will repay for the death of every Afghan child.\" His friends have tried to empathise. \"He's a dad,\" says Lance Stephensen, a member of a group called Boise Valley POW-MIA Corporation. Their motorcycles were parked outside the Idaho National Guard headquarters on Sunday. \"Think of the pressure and stress.\" At the press conference Robert Bergdahl hinted at some of the struggles that he and others faced while they tried to get his son released. \"You'll never know how complicated this was,\" he said at the press conference. Whether mistaken or not, Robert Bergdahl's rogue campaign ended well. He told journalists that his son would soon go from Landstuhl Medical Center in Germany to an army medical centre in Texas to help him adjust to the US.

{"article": "This pointer takes the form of a nickel signature in the rocks of the crater that is now buried under ocean sediments in the Gulf of Mexico. An international team has just drilled into the 200km-wide depression. It hopes the investigation can help explain why the event 66 million years ago was so catastrophic. Seventy-five percent of all life, not just the dinosaurs, went extinct. The UK-US led team gave an update on its research here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. The group is currently running all manner of lab tests on the hundreds of metres of core pulled up from under the Gulf in April and May. One tantalising revelation is that the scientists observe a big nickel spike in the sediments immediately above what has become known as Chicxulub Crater. This is an important marker that could lead on to the discovery of asteroid material itself. The presumed 15km-wide space object would have been vaporised in the impact. But some portion of it would have condensed into small spherules in the sky to then rain back down on the bowl. It should be stressed that the nickel is not in itself an identification of asteroid material. To have real confidence, the scientists would prefer to see the element iridium. This is extremely rare on Earth but is frequently associated with meteorites. Iridium is apparent in the geological layers around the globe that mark the dinosaur-killing event at the end of the Cretaceous Period, but to find it in the actual crater would be an exciting observation. It could result in further insights on the nature of the asteroid that smashed into Earth. One theory is that its metals could have made the environment toxic for many lifeforms. Four labs are currently testing for the presence of iridium. Prof Philippe Claeys from the Free University in Brussels says finding the Nickel is a very good sign. \"Nickel behaves chemically in a way that is very similar to iridium; it loves to make strong chemical bonds with iron, just like iridium,\" he told BBC News. \"So we treat nickel as what we call a proxy for an elevated concentration of iridium. If we see high nickel, it's very likely that we're going to have high iridium.\" Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). Rock was recovered from more than 1,300m below the modern seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico. What has thrilled the team is the quality and abundance of material now in the labs. \"Why this is a jackpot core is because we have an expanded section. We have an amount of material that turns into a resolution that allows us to ask lots of questions,\" said Prof Sean Gulick, the co-chief scientist from the University of Texas at Austin, US. \"For example, if we do see iridium especially in dust, it's not just a tracer for the impactor, it could also tell us something about when this material left the atmosphere and things (the likely dark sky conditions following the impact) started clearing up.\" Prof Tim Bralower from Pennsylvania State University is studying the core rocks for the fossils of tiny organisms that lived in the seawater above the crater - from the immediate aftermath of the impact to millions of years hence. What sort of species are present and how they change up through the sediments should tell him something about how long it took for \"normal conditions\" to return. \"It's unusual to see such a beautiful record of recovery in this exact location where the mass extinction originated. Basically, 'ground zero',\" he said.

{"article": "It refers to the amount the Pentagon spends on erectile dysfunction medication annually: about $84m (\u00c2\u00a363m), according to the Military Times newspaper. In contrast, the Rand Corporation think tank estimated last year that gender transition-related health care costs for transgender personnel would increase the military's active duty health budget by $8.4m per year at the most. But why does the US defence department spend so much on erectile dysfunction drugs? First, it is worth pointing out that the Military Times' February 2015 report based its figure on 2014 data from the Defense Health Agency. The spend of $84.2m was for that year, but the newspaper also reported that $294m had been spent on Viagra, Cialis and other such medications since 2011. It pointed out that this cost the equivalent of more than a few fighter jets. In 2014, some 1.18 million prescriptions were filled, mostly for Viagra. But who were they for? The answer goes some way in explaining the massive spend. It is true that some of the erectile dysfunction medication went to active-duty personnel. But the vast majority went to other groups eligible, including millions of military retirees and their family members. In fact, around 10 million people in total are estimated to be covered by the Pentagon's healthcare system, which cost $52bn in 2012. It is well known that erectile dysfunction is more common among older men - which would explain a hefty bill for retired service members. In fact, less than 10% of the prescriptions were for active duty personnel, according to the Military Times. Still, erectile dysfunction among those currently serving in the US military has been increasing since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began. A 2014 study by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) found that 100,248 cases of erectile dysfunction were diagnosed among active service members between 2004 and 2013, with \"annual incidence rates\" more than doubling in that time period. Nearly half of all the cases were due to psychological causes, according to the study. A study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2015 found that male veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were \"significantly more likely than their civilian counterparts to report erectile dysfunction or other sexual problems\", according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs. One study cited found that 85% of male combat veterans with PTSD report erectile dysfunction, nearly four times the rate among those returning from combat who are not diagnosed with a mental health disorder. In 2008, the Rand Corporation reported that one in five US veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were suffering from PTSD or major depression. However, a key statistic buried in the AFHSB study of active duty personnel between 2004 and 2013 suggests one should be cautious of reading too much into the links between America's recent wars, PTSD and erectile dysfunction in relation to the military's massive spend on Viagra. Personnel who had never been deployed were actually more likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction than their counterparts who had been. Finally, erectile dysfunction is linked to common conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. In 2007, it was estimated that the prevalence of erectile dysfunction among US men was 18%. In summary: it is a common condition, and the US military pays for the healthcare of millions of men, meaning it spends a lot on Viagra and other such drugs.", "question": "Amid the fall - out from US President Donald Trump 's announcement on Twitter that transgender people will not be able to serve in the US military , one statistic has been frequently @placeholder to draw attention to the comparatively small estimated costs of transgender healthcare .", "option_0": "urged", "option_1": "applied", "option_2": "held", "option_3": "struggling", "option_4": "raised", "label": 4}
{"article": "Part of the area at Llanberis in Gwynedd was home to a former RAF ammunitions store that was cleared in the 1970s. A report for the developers suggests some unexploded munitions could remain buried in the former quarry. But it said German nerve gas was removed and destroyed decades ago. The power company Snowdonia Pump Hydro (SPH) want to use the old Glyn Rhonwy quarry as the site of a 600 MWh pumped electricity storage facility. Those proposals are now being considered by the UK's Planning Inspectorate. However, opponents of the scheme in the area have concerns over possible contamination at the Glyn Rhonwy workings. The slate quarry was used as a secret munitions store during WW2, and later it was used to dispose of old and surplus bombs, bullets and grenades. Thousands of tonnes of weapons ended up in quarry pits there, prompting a massive RAF clean-up operation that only ended in the mid-1970s. The 'Concerned about Glyn Rhonwy' group said they believed that chemical weapons may have also been dumped or buried at the site.. A consultant's report confirmed that 70,000 German tabun nerve gas shells seized following WW2 were held at the Llanberis quarry for a short time. They were later moved to another facility near Caernarfon, and eventually dumped at sea. SPH commissioned consultants Zetica to examine issues surrounding unexploded munitions at the site, as part of the planning process. \"Nobody takes this issue lightly,\" stressed a spokesman for the hydro power company. \"We rely on the information in the Zetica report. It confirms that the German tabun bombs were held for a short time in a secure area at Glyn Rhonwy. There is no evidence that they were stored in any other area.\" The consultants stated that an official UK board of inquiry in the 1960s found \"all German chemical weapons appeared to have been successfully removed from RAF Llanberis\". But the Glyn Rhonwy campaigners have insisted that there can be no guarantees that every single tabun shell was removed. \"We think there is at least one discarded tabun bomb on the site,\" said Jeff Taylor, from the campaign group. He said that was based on documents uncovered in an archive relating to the quarry, which showed images of tabun bombs in Germany, and what appears to be the case of a similar bomb lying in a slate rock crevice. \"It is circumstantial evidence, but it is pretty damaging circumstantial evidence,\" argued Mr Taylor. Chemist Dr Dave Peskett, who has carried out research on the issue for the campaign group, said he had seen documents suggesting discarded mustard gas shells had also been dumped at the quarry in the past. The allegation is also disputed. But Dr Peskett added: \"It is not just the munitions that are the issue here. There's a huge pile of toxic residue there. \"Someone has to come in and remediate that site before any development takes place.\" The spokesman for SPH said tests had been carried out on water samples in the quarry in both 2012 and 2015, and no contamination was found. They added that \"in the unlikely event\" that unexploded ordnance was uncovered at Glyn Rhonwy, it would be dealt with in a \"rigorous\" process. \"It will ensure the safety of the people and the environment,\" said the official. BBC Wales has asked the Ministry of Defence to respond to concerns surrounding the site. However, a freedom of information request for details regarding the German nerve gas at Llanberis by the Concerned group was rejected stating that \"release of the information would enable ill-disposed persons or organisations to act against the national interest, and that therefore on balance the information should be withheld\".", "question": "Campaigners @placeholder to a planned hydro-electric pumping station in Snowdonia say the site could be contaminated by World War Two nerve gas .", "option_0": "opposed", "option_1": "according", "option_2": "belonging", "option_3": "eased", "option_4": "clinging", "label": 0}

There had been fears that Zambia, who had looked impressive all tournament, may crack under the weight of expectation but the junior Chipolopolo held their cool to go into the break leading 2-0. Senegalese goalkeeper Lamine Sarr made two horrendous errors that a merciless Zambian frontline punished him for. The two sides had been sizing each other up in the opening minutes with Senegal having the first sight of goal when Ibrahima Niane's tame shot was easily picked up by Mangani Banda in the seventh minute. Zambia roared to life in the 14th minute when Fashion Sakala controlled the ball in the box but his ferociously struck shot went wide. Three minutes later Sakala was back on the by-line to tease the ball into the box with Sarr spilling it into the path of a grateful Patson Daka (pictured) whose predatory instincts came to life, toeing home.

Haining, now 41, ran two hours, 36 minutes and 52 seconds in London and could yet become Scotland's oldest ever female athlete at a Commonwealth Games. Hawkins was the top British runner in the elite men's race. He ran 2:16:50 in only his second marathon.

McLachlan's 7.86m pushed him into second place in the Scottish all-time list for the long jump behind record-holder Darren Ritchie and was well clear of the 7.60m that is the Glasgow 2014 standard.

She was always liable to have a go at the Glasgow 2014 standard. \"But I certainly do think the thought of the Games coming up will make people work harder in training and compete better. \"I'm certainly hoping now that being nine minutes inside the women's marathon standard will mean I am in a good position but there's a long way to go until the selection periods close. \"There is plenty of time for other people to run marathons.\"", "question": "The @placeholder running Scottish athletics hopes Glasgow 's staging of the 2014 Commonwealth Games is already having a positive effect on the athletes .", "option_0": "longer", "option_1": "body", "option_2": "county", "option_3": "public", "option_4": "team", "label": 1}
{"article": "The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh warned that being overweight may now be considered \"the norm\". It claimed a tax would help fund the \"spiralling\" healthcare costs associated with the problem. The British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) insisted that the case is \"not compelling\". It cited research which suggested a 20% tax would save just four calories per day. Liverpool University chair of clinical epidemiology, Simon Capewell, is due to speak at a conference on the issue in Edinburgh later, entitled: \"Obesity: A 21st Century Epidemic\". Professor Capewell will cite Mexico as one example where a 10% sugary drinks tax is believed to have contributed to a 10% reduction in the consumption of such beverages while Finland, France, Hungary, Latvia and the USA have also introduced sugar taxes. He said: \"The revenues raised can then be invested back into initiatives to increase children's health in these countries, as is happening in Mexico. \"Scotland has an excellent track record in addressing public health issues. Notable achievements include smoke-free public places and proposals for minimum unit pricing for alcohol. We need to explore how these developments could be repeated with sugary drinks.\" Gavin Partington, BSDA director general, said: \"The efforts by soft drinks companies including product reformulation, smaller pack sizes and increased promotion of low and no-calorie drinks have led to a 7% reduction in calories from soft drinks in the last three years. \"It's also worth noting that politicians in Belgium and Denmark rejected the notion of a tax in 2013 and the experience in France shows that while sales of soft drinks initially fell after a tax was introduced in 2012, they have increased since.\"", "question": "Doctors have called for the introduction of a tax on sugary @placeholder and drinks to tackle what they describe as an \" obesity epidemic \" .", "option_0": "food", "option_1": "terms", "option_2": "head", "option_3": "unit", "option_4": "snacks", "label": 0}

Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said he was \"optimistic\". Greece is facing billions of euros worth of debt repayments in July. Slovak Finance Minister Peter Kazimir said: \"I really hope the Euclid will fly back home with a briefcase stuffed with money.\" Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will attend the meeting in Luxembourg. Germany, Europe's largest economy, is the biggest contributor to the rescue and its government has stipulated that in order for more money to be released to Greece, the IMF must join the bailout. However, in turn, the IMF wants clarity on longer term debt relief for Greece once the current funding scheme runs out next year. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of the Eurogroup, said: \"Today we will give more clarity to Greece and to the IMF (on) how we will move forward, how we will calibrate debt relief needed next year. \"There won't be a figure that rolls out... the figure will only come at the end of the programme,\" he said.", "question": "Germany is confident that its struggling eurozone @placeholder Greece will secure the funding it needs to pay its bills .", "option_0": "activities", "option_1": "shows", "option_2": "fleet", "option_3": "neighbour", "option_4": "crop", "label": 3}
